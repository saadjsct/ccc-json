****** I. The Life of Man - To Know and Love God
******** 1
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/prologue.htm#1][1]] God, infinitely perfect and blessed in himself, in a plan of sheer goodness freely created man to make him share in his own blessed life. For this reason, at every time and in every place, God draws close to man. He calls man to seek him, to know him, to love him with all his strength. He calls together all men, scattered and divided by sin, into the unity of his family, the Church. To accomplish this, when the fullness of time had come, God sent his Son as Redeemer and Savior. In his Son and through him, he invites men to become, in the Holy Spirit, his adopted children and thus heirs of his blessed life.

******** 2
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/prologue.htm#2][2]] So that this call should resound throughout the world, Christ sent forth the apostles he had chosen, commissioning them to proclaim the gospel: "Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you; and lo, I am with you always, to the close of the age." [fn:4] Strengthened by this mission, the apostles "went forth and preached everywhere, while the Lord worked with them and confirmed the message by the signs that attended it." [fn:5]

[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/prologue.htm#3][3]] Those who with God's help have welcomed Christ's call and freely responded to it are urged on by love of Christ to proclaim the Good News everywhere in the world. This treasure, received from the apostles, has been faithfully guarded by their successors.  All Christ's faithful are called to hand it on from generation to  generation, by professing the faith, by living it in fraternal sharing, and by celebrating it in liturgy and prayer. [fn:6]

****** II. Handing on the Faith: Catechesis
******** 4
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/prologue.htm#4][4]] Quite early on, the name /catechesis/ was given to the totality of the Church's efforts to make disciples, to help men believe that Jesus is the Son of God so that believing they might have life in his name, and to educate and instruct them in this life, thus building up the body of Christ.

[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/prologue.htm#5][5]] "Catechesis is an /education in the faith/ of children, young people and adults which includes especially the teaching of Christian doctrine imparted, generally speaking, in an organic and systematic way, with a view to initiating the hearers into the fullness of Christian life."

******** 6
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/prologue.htm#6][6]] While not being formally identified with them, catechesis is built on a certain number of elements of the Church's pastoral mission which have a catechetical aspect, that prepare for catechesis, or spring from it. They are: the initial proclamation of the Gospel or missionary preaching to arouse faith; examination of the reasons for belief; experience of Christian living; celebration of the sacraments; integration into the ecclesial community; and apostolic and missionary witness. [fn:9]

******** 7
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/prologue.htm#7][7]] "Catechesis is intimately bound up with the whole of the Church's life. Not only her geographical extension and numerical increase, but even more her inner growth and correspondence with God's plan depend  essentially on catechesis." [fn:10]

:end:

******** 8
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/prologue.htm#8][8]] Periods of renewal in the Church are also intense moments of catechesis. In the great era of the Fathers of the Church, saintly bishops devoted an important part of their ministry to catechesis. St. Cyril of Jerusalem and St. John Chrysostom, St. Ambrose and St. Augustine, and many other Fathers wrote catechetical works that remain models for us. [fn:11]

[fn:11] Cf. CT 12
:end:

******** 9
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/prologue.htm#9][9]] "The ministry of catechesis draws ever fresh energy from the councils. The Council of Trent is a noteworthy example of this. It gave catechesis priority in its constitutions and decrees. It lies at the origin of the /Roman Catechism/ , which is also known by the name of that council and which is a work of the first rank as a summary of Christian teaching. . . ." [fn:12] The Council of Trent initiated a remarkable organization of the Church's catechesis. Thanks to the work of holy bishops and theologians such as St. Peter Canisius, St. Charles Borromeo, St. Turibius of Mongrovejo or St. Robert Bellarmine, it occasioned the publication of numerous catechisms.

[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/prologue.htm#10][10]] It is therefore no surprise that catechesis in the Church has again attracted attention in the wake of the Second Vatican Council, which Pope Paul VI considered the great catechism of modern times. The General   Catechetical Directory (1971) the sessions of the Synod of Bishops devoted to evangelization (1974) and catechesis (1977), the apostolic exhortations /Evangelii nuntiandi/ (1975) and /Catechesi tradendae/ (1979), attest to this. The Extraordinary Synod of Bishops in 1985 asked "that a catechism or compendium of all Catholic doctrine regarding both faith and morals be composed" [fn:13] The Holy Father, Pope John Paul II, made the Synod's wish his own, acknowledging that "this desire wholly corresponds to a real need of the universal Church and of the particular Churches." [fn:14] He set in motion everything needed to carry out the Synod Fathers' wish.

****** III. The Aim and Intended Readership of This Catechism
******** 11
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/prologue.htm#11][11]] This catechism aims at presenting an organic synthesis of the essential and fundamental contents of Catholic doctrine, as regards both faith and morals, in the light of the Second Vatican Council and the whole of the Church's Tradition. Its principal sources are the Sacred Scriptures, the Fathers of the Church, the liturgy, and the Church's Magisterium. It is intended to serve "as a point of reference for the catechisms or compendia that are composed in the various countries". [fn:15]

:end:

******** 12
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/prologue.htm#12][12]] This work is intended primarily for those responsible for catechesis: first of all the bishops, as teachers of the faith and pastors of the Church. It is offered to them as an instrument in fulfilling their responsibility of teaching the People of God. Through the bishops, it is addressed to redactors of catechisms, to priests, and to catechists. It will also be useful reading for all other Christian faithful.

****** IV. Structure of This Catechism
******** 13
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/prologue.htm#13][13]] The plan of this catechism is inspired by the great tradition of catechisms which build catechesis on four pillars: the baptismal profession of faith (the /Creed/ ), the sacraments of faith, the life of faith (the /Commandments/ ), and the prayer of the believer (the /Lord's Prayer/ ).

******* Part One: The Profession of Faith
******** 14
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/prologue.htm#14][14]] Those who belong to Christ through faith and Baptism must confess their baptismal faith before men. [fn:16] First therefore the Catechism expounds revelation, by which God addresses and gives himself to man, and the faith by which man responds to God ( /Section One/ ). The profession of faith summarizes the gifts that God gives man: as the Author of all that is good; as Redeemer; and as Sanctifier. It develops these in the three chapters on our baptismal faith in the one God: the almighty /Father/ , the Creator; his /Son/ Jesus Christ, our Lord and Savior; and the /Holy Spirit/ , the Sanctifier, in the Holy Church ( /Section Two/ ).
:refs:
[fn:16] Cf. Mt 10:32; Rom 10:9
:end:

******* Part Two: The Sacraments of Faith
******** 15
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/prologue.htm#15][15]] The second part of the Catechism explains how God's salvation, accomplished once for all through Christ Jesus and the Holy Spirit, is made present in the sacred actions of the Church's liturgy ( /Section One/ ), especially in the seven sacraments ( /Section Two/ ).

******* Part Three: The Life of Faith
******** 16
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/prologue.htm#16][16]] The third part of the Catechism deals with the final end of man created in the image of God: beatitude, and the ways of reaching it - through right conduct freely chosen, with the help of God's law and grace ( /Section One/ ), and through conduct that fulfills the twofold commandment of charity, specified in God's Ten Commandments ( /Section Two/ ).

******* Part Four: Prayer in the Life of Faith
******** 17
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/prologue.htm#17][17]] The last part of the Catechism deals with the meaning and importance of prayer in the life of believers ( /Section One/ ). It concludes with a brief commentary on the seven petitions of the Lord's Prayer ( /Section Two/ ), for indeed we find in these the sum of all the good things which we must hope for, and which our heavenly Father wants to grant us.

****** V. Practical Directions for Using This Catechism
******** 18
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/prologue.htm#18][18]] This catechism is conceived as /an organic presentation/ of the Catholic faith in its entirety. It should be seen therefore as a unified whole. Numerous cross-references in the margin of the text (numbers found at the end of a sentence referring to other paragraphs that deal with the same theme), as well as the analytical index at the end of the volume, allow the reader to view each theme in its relationship with the entirety of the faith.

******** 19
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/prologue.htm#19][19]] The texts of Sacred Scripture are often not quoted word for word but are merely indicated by a reference ( cf. ). For a deeper understanding of such passages, the reader should refer to the Scriptural texts themselves. Such Biblical references are a valuable working-tool in catechesis.

******** 20
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/prologue.htm#20][20]] The use of small print in certain passages indicates observations of an historical or apologetic nature, or supplementary doctrinal explanations.

******** 21
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/prologue.htm#21][21]] The quotations , also in small print, from patristic, liturgical, magisterial or hagiographical sources, are intended to enrich the doctrinal presentations. These texts have often been chosen with a view to direct catechetical use.

******** 22
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/prologue.htm#22][22]] At the end of each thematic unit, a series of brief texts in small italics sums up the essentials of that unit's teaching in condensed formula. These IN BRIEF summaries may suggest to local catechists brief summary formula that could be memorized.

****** VI. Necessary Adaptations
******** 23
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/prologue.htm#23][23]] The Catechism emphasizes the exposition of doctrine. It seeks to help deepen understanding of faith. In this way it is oriented towards the maturing of that faith, its putting down roots in personal life, and its shining forth in personal conduct. [fn:17]

[fn:17] Cf. CT 20-22; 25
:end:

******** 24
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/prologue.htm#24][24]] By design, this Catechism does not set out to provide the adaptation of doctrinal presentations and catechetical methods required by the differences of culture, age, spiritual maturity, and social and ecclesial condition among all those to whom it is addressed. Such indispensable adaptations are the responsibility of particular catechisms and, even more, of those who instruct the faithful:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
 Whoever teaches must become "all things to all men" ( /1 Cor/ 9:22), to win everyone to Christ. . . . Above all, teachers must not imagine that a single kind of soul has been entrusted to them, and that consequently it is lawful to teach and form equally all the faithful in true piety with one and the same method! Let them realize that some are in Christ as newborn babes, others as adolescents, and still others as adults in full command of their powers. . . . Those who are called to the ministry of preaching must suit their words to the maturity and understanding of their hearers, as they hand on the teaching of the mysteries of faith and the rules of moral conduct.

[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/prologue.htm#25][25]] To conclude this Prologue, it is fitting to recall this pastoral principle stated by the /Roman Catechism/ :

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
 The whole concern of doctrine and its teaching must be directed to the love that never ends. Whether something is proposed for belief, for hope or for action, the love of our Lord must always be made accessible, so that anyone can see that all the works of perfect Christian virtue spring from love and have no other objective than to arrive at love.

* PART ONE - THE PROFESSION OF FAITH
** SECTION ONE: "I BELIEVE" - "WE BELIEVE"
******** 26
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p1s1c1.htm#26][26]] We begin our profession of faith by saying: "I believe" or "We believe". Before expounding the Church's faith, as confessed in the Creed, celebrated in the liturgy and lived in observance of God's commandments and in prayer, we must first ask what "to believe" means. Faith is man's response to God, who reveals himself and gives himself to man, at the same time bringing man a superabundant light as he searches for the ultimate meaning of his life. Thus we shall consider first that search ( /Chapter One/ ), then the divine Revelation by which God comes to meet man ( /Chapter  Two/ ), and finally the response of faith ( /Chapter Three/ ).

*** CHAPTER ONE: MAN'S CAPACITY FOR GOD
****** I. The Desire for God
******** 27
⁘[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p1s1c1.htm#27][27]] The desire for God is written in the human heart, because man is created by God and for God; and God never ceases to draw man to himself. Only in God will he find the truth and happiness he never stops searching for:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
 The dignity of man rests above all on the fact that he is called to communion with God.  This invitation to converse with God is addressed to man as soon as he comes into being. For if man exists it is because God has created him through love, and through love continues to hold him in existence. He cannot live fully according to truth unless he freely acknowledges that love and entrusts himself to his creator. [fn:20]

******** 28
⁘[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p1s1c1.htm#28][28]] In many ways, throughout history down to the present day, men have given expression to their quest for God in their religious beliefs and behavior: in their prayers, sacrifices, rituals, meditations, and so forth. These forms of religious expression, despite the ambiguities they often bring with them, are so universal that one may well call man a /religious being/ :

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
 From one ancestor [God] made all nations to inhabit the whole earth, and he allotted the times of their existence and the boundaries of the places where they would live, so that they would search for God and perhaps grope for him and find him - though indeed he is not far from each one of us.

[fn:22] Such attitudes can have different causes: revolt against evil in the world; religious ignorance or indifference; the cares and riches of this world; the scandal of bad example on the part of believers; currents of thought hostile to religion; finally, that attitude of sinful man which makes him hide from God out of fear and flee his call.

⁘[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p1s1c1.htm#30][30]] "Let the hearts of those who seek the LORD rejoice." [fn:24] Although man can forget God or reject him, He never ceases to call every man to seek him, so as to find life and happiness. But this search for God demands of man every effort of intellect, a sound will, "an upright heart", as well as the witness of others who teach him to seek God.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
 You are great, O Lord, and greatly to be praised: great is your power and your wisdom is without measure. And man, so small a part of your creation, wants to praise you: this man, though clothed with mortality and bearing the evidence of sin and the proof that you withstand the proud. Despite everything, man, though but a small a part of your creation, wants to praise you. You yourself encourage him to delight in your praise, for you have made us for yourself, and our heart is restless until it rests in you. [fn:25]

******** 31
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p1s1c1.htm#31][31]] Created in God's image and called to know and love him, the person who seeks God discovers certain ways of coming to know him. These are also called proofs for the existence of God, not in the sense of proofs in the natural sciences, but rather in the sense of "converging and convincing arguments", which allow us to attain certainty about the truth. These "ways" of approaching God from creation have a twofold point of departure: the physical world, and the human person.

******** 32
⁘[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p1s1c1.htm#32][32]] The /world/ : starting from movement, becoming, contingency, and the world's order and beauty, one can come to a knowledge of God as the origin and the end of the universe.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
 As St. Paul says of the Gentiles: For what can be known about God is plain to them, because God has shown it to them. Ever since the creation of the world his invisible nature, namely, his eternal power and deity, has been clearly perceived in the things that have been made. [fn:26]

 Though human reason is, strictly speaking, truly capable by its own natural power and light of attaining to a true and certain knowledge of the one personal God, who watches over and controls the world by his providence, and of the natural law written in our hearts by the Creator; yet there are many obstacles which prevent reason from the effective and fruitful use of this inborn faculty. For the truths that concern the relations between God and man wholly transcend the visible order of things, and, if they are translated into human action and influence it, they call for self-surrender and abnegation. The human mind, in its turn, is hampered in the attaining of such truths, not only by the impact of the senses and the imagination, but also by disordered appetites which are the consequences of original sin. So it happens that men in such matters easily persuade themselves that what they would not like to be true is false or at least doubtful. [fn:32]

But there is another order of knowledge, which man cannot possibly arrive at by his own powers: the order of divine Revelation. [fn:38] Through an utterly free decision, God has revealed himself and given himself to man. This he does by revealing the mystery, his plan of loving goodness, formed from all eternity in Christ, for the benefit of all men. God has fully revealed this plan by sending us his beloved Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, and the Holy Spirit.

But it is no less true that believing is an authentically human act. Trusting in God and cleaving to the truths he has revealed is contrary neither to human freedom nor to human reason. Even in human relations it is not contrary to our dignity to believe what other persons tell us about themselves and their intentions, or to trust their promises (for example, when a man and a woman marry) to share a communion of life with one another. If this is so, still less is it contrary to our dignity to "yield by faith the full submission of. . . intellect and will to God who reveals", [fn:173] and to share in an interior communion with him.

****** IN BRIEF
******** 176
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p1s1c3a2.htm#176][176]] Faith is a personal adherence of the whole man to God who reveals himself. It involves an assent of the intellect and will to the self-revelation God has made through his deeds and words.

******** 177
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p1s1c3a2.htm#177][177]] "To believe" has thus a twofold reference: to the person, and to the truth: to the truth, by trust in the person who bears witness to it.

******** 178
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p1s1c3a2.htm#178][178]] We must believe in no one but God: the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.

******** 179
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p1s1c3a2.htm#179][179]] Faith is a supernatural gift from God. In order to believe, man needs the interior helps of the Holy Spirit.

******** 180
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p1s1c3a2.htm#180][180]] "Believing" is a human act, conscious and free, corresponding to the dignity of the human person.

******** 181
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p1s1c3a2.htm#181][181]] "Believing" is an ecclesial act. The Church's faith precedes, engenders, supports and nourishes our faith. The Church is the mother of all believers. "No one can have God as Father who does not have the Church as Mother" (St. Cyprian, /De unit/ . 6: PL 4, 519).

******** 182
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p1s1c3a2.htm#182][182]] We believe all "that which is contained in the word of God, written or handed down, and which the Church proposes for belief as divinely revealed" (Paul VI, CPG § 20).

******** 183
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p1s1c3a2.htm#183][183]] Faith is necessary for salvation. The Lord himself affirms: "He who believes and is baptized will be saved; but he who does not believe will be condemned" ( /Mk/ 16:16).

******** 184
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p1s1c3a2.htm#184][184]] "Faith is a foretaste of the knowledge that will make us blessed in the life to come" (St. Thomas Aquinas. /Comp. theol/ .  1, 2).

******** 186
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p1s2.htm#186][186]] From the beginning, the apostolic Church expressed and handed on her faith in brief formula normative for all. [fn:210] But already very early on, the Church also wanted to gather the essential elements of her faith into organic and articulated summaries, intended especially for candidates for Baptism:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
 This synthesis of faith was not made to accord with human opinions, but rather what was of the greatest importance was gathered from all the Scriptures, to present the one teaching of the faith in its entirety. And just as the mustard seed contains a great number of branches in a tiny grain, so too this summary of faith encompassed in a few words the whole knowledge of the true religion contained in the Old and the New Testaments.

:end:

******** 187
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p1s2.htm#187][187]] Such syntheses are called "professions of faith" since they summarize the faith that Christians profess. They are called "creeds" on account of what is usually their first word in Latin: /credo/ ("I believe"). They are also called "symbols of faith".

******** 188
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p1s2.htm#188][188]] The Greek word /symbolon/ meant half of a broken object, for example, a seal presented as a token of recognition. The broken parts were placed together to verify the bearer's identity. The symbol of faith, then, is a sign of recognition and communion between believers. /Symbolon/ also means a gathering, collection or summary. A symbol of faith is a summary of the principal truths of the faith and therefore serves as the first and fundamental point of reference for catechesis.

******** 189
⁘[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p1s2.htm#189][189]] The first "profession of faith" is made during Baptism.  The symbol of faith is first and foremost the /baptismal/ creed.  Since Baptism is given "in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit", [fn:212] the truths of faith professed during Baptism are articulated in terms of their reference to the three persons of the Holy Trinity.

Indeed, just as in our bodily members there are certain articulations which distinguish and separate them, so too in this profession of faith, the name /articles/ has justly and rightly been given to the truths we must believe particularly and distinctly." [fn:215] In accordance with an ancient tradition, already attested to by St. Ambrose, it is also customary to reckon the articles of the Creed as /twelve/ , thus symbolizing the fullness of the apostolic faith by the number of the apostles.

[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p1s2.htm#193][193]] None of the creeds from the different stages in the Church's life can be considered superseded or irrelevant. They help us today to attain and deepen the faith of all times by means of the different summaries made of it.

 Among all the creeds, two occupy a special place in the Church's life:

******** 194
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p1s2.htm#194][194]] /The Apostles' Creed/ is so called because it is rightly considered to be a faithful summary of the apostles' faith. It is the ancient baptismal symbol of the Church of Rome. Its great authority arises from this fact: it is "the Creed of the Roman Church, the See of Peter the first of the apostles, to which he brought the common faith". [fn:222]

******** 195
⁘[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p1s2.htm#195][195]] /The Niceno-Constantinopolitan/ or /Nicene Creed/ draws its great authority from the fact that it stems from the first two ecumenical Councils (in 325 and 381). It remains common to all the great Churches of both East and West to this day.

The language of faith thus draws on the human experience of parents, who are in a way the first representatives of God for man. But this experience also tells us that human parents are fallible and can disfigure the face of fatherhood and motherhood. We ought therefore to recall that God transcends the human distinction between the sexes.  He is neither man nor woman: he is God.

God is love: Father, Son and Holy Spirit. God freely wills to communicate the glory of his blessed life. Such is the "plan of his loving kindness", conceived by the Father before the foundation of the world, in his beloved Son: "He destined us in love to be his sons" and "to be conformed to the image of his Son", through "the spirit of sonship". [fn:318] This plan is a "grace [which] was given to us in Christ Jesus before the ages began", stemming immediately from Trinitarian love.

Thus the Church confesses, following the New Testament, "one God and Father from whom all things are, and one Lord Jesus Christ, through whom all things are, and one Holy Spirit in whom all things are".

******** 261
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p1s2c1p2.htm#261][261]] The mystery of the Most Holy Trinity is the central mystery of the Christian faith and of Christian life. God alone can make it known to us by revealing himself as Father, Son and Holy Spirit.

******** 262
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p1s2c1p2.htm#262][262]] The Incarnation of God's Son reveals that God is the eternal Father and that the Son is consubstantial with the Father, which means that, in the Father and with the Father the Son is one and the same God.

[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p1s2c1p2.htm#263][263]] The mission of the Holy Spirit, sent by the Father in the name of the Son ( /Jn/ 14:26) and by the Son "from the Father" ( /Jn/ 15:26), reveals that, with them, the Spirit is one and the same God. "With the Father and the Son he is worshipped and glorified" (Nicene Creed).

[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p1s2c1p2.htm#264][264]] "The Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father as the first principle and, by the eternal gift of this to the Son, from the communion of both the Father and the Son" (St. Augustine, /De Trin/ . 15, 26, 47: PL 42, 1095).

******** 265
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p1s2c1p2.htm#265][265]] By the grace of Baptism "in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit", we are called to share in the life of the Blessed Trinity, here on earth in the obscurity of faith, and after death in eternal light (cf. Paul VI, /CPG/ § 9).

******** 266
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p1s2c1p2.htm#266][266]] "Now this is the Catholic faith: We worship one God in the Trinity and the Trinity in unity, without either confusing the persons or dividing the substance; for the person of the Father is one, the Son's is another, the Holy Spirit's another; but the Godhead of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit is one, their glory equal, their majesty coeternal" (Athanasian Creed: DS 75; ND 16).

******** 267
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p1s2c1p2.htm#267][267]] Inseparable in what they are, the divine persons are also inseparable in what they do.

response of the Christian faith to the basic question that men of all times have asked themselves: [fn:342] "Where do we come from?"  "Where are we going?" "What is our origin?" "What is our end?"

These discoveries invite us to even greater admiration for the greatness of the Creator, prompting us to give him thanks for all his works and for the understanding and wisdom he gives to scholars and researchers.

[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p1s2c1p4.htm#284][284]] The great interest accorded to these studies is strongly stimulated by a question of another order, which goes beyond the proper domain of the natural sciences. It is not only a question of knowing when and how the universe arose physically, or when man appeared, but rather of discovering the meaning of such an origin: is the universe governed by chance, blind fate, anonymous necessity, or by a transcendent, intelligent and good Being called "God"? And if the world does come from God's wisdom and goodness, why is there evil? Where does it come from? Who is responsible for it? Is there any liberation from it?

******** 285
⁘[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p1s2c1p4.htm#285][285]] Since the beginning the Christian faith has been challenged by responses to the question of origins that differ from its own. Ancient religions and cultures produced many myths concerning origins. Some philosophers have said that everything is God, that the world is God, or that the development of the world is the development of God (Pantheism). Others have said that the world is a necessary emanation arising from God and returning to him. Still others have affirmed the existence of two eternal principles, Good and Evil, Light and Darkness, locked, in permanent conflict (Dualism, Manichaeism). According to some of these conceptions, the world (at least the physical world) is evil, the product of a fall, and is thus to be rejected or left behind (Gnosticism). Some admit that the world was made by God, but as by a watch-maker who, once he has made a watch, abandons it to itself (Deism). Finally, others reject any transcendent origin for the world, but see it as merely the interplay of matter that has always existed (Materialism). All these attempts bear witness to the permanence and universality of the question of origins. This inquiry is distinctively human.

⁘[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p1s2c1p4.htm#290][290]] "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth": [fn:350] three things are affirmed in these first words of Scripture: the eternal God gave a beginning to all that exists outside of himself; he alone is Creator (the verb "create" - Hebrew /bara/ - always has God for its subject). The totality of what exists (expressed by the formula "the heavens and the earth") depends on the One who gives it being.

[fn:351] The New Testament reveals that God created everything by the eternal Word, his beloved Son. In him "all things were created, in heaven and on earth.. . all things were created through him and for him. He is before all things, and in him all things hold together." [fn:352] The Church's faith likewise confesses the creative action of the Holy Spirit, the "giver of life", "the Creator Spirit" ( /Veni, Creator Spiritus/ ), the "source of every good". [fn:353]

[fn:374] Our human understanding, which shares in the light of the divine intellect, can understand what God tells us by means of his creation, though not without great effort and only in a spirit of humility and respect before the Creator and his work. [fn:375] Because creation comes forth from God's goodness, it shares in that goodness - "And God saw that it was good. . . very good" [fn:376] - for God willed creation as a gift addressed to man, an inheritance destined for and entrusted to him. On many occasions the Church has had to defend the goodness of creation, including that of the physical world. [fn:377]

****** V. God Carries Out His Plan: Divine Providence
******** 302
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p1s2c1p4.htm#302][302]] Creation has its own goodness and proper perfection, but it did not spring forth complete from the hands of the Creator. The universe was created "in a state of journeying" ( /in statu viae/ ) toward an ultimate perfection yet to be attained, to which God has destined it. We call "divine providence" the dispositions by which God guides his creation toward this perfection:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
 By his providence God protects and governs all things which he has made, "reaching mightily from one end of the earth to the other, and ordering all things well". For "all are open and laid bare to his eyes", even those things which are yet to come into existence through the free action of creatures. [fn:383]

The sacred books powerfully affirm God's absolute sovereignty over the course of events: "Our God is in the heavens; he does whatever he pleases." [fn:384] And so it is with Christ, "who opens and no one shall shut, who shuts and no one opens". [fn:385] As the book of Proverbs states: "Many are the plans in the mind of a man, but it is the purpose of the LORD that will be established." [fn:386]

[fn:390] God thus enables men to be intelligent and free causes in order to complete the work of creation, to perfect its harmony for their own good and that of their neighbors. Though often unconscious collaborators with God's will, they can also enter deliberately into the divine plan by their actions, their prayers and their sufferings.

Drawn from nothingness by God's power, wisdom and goodness, it can do nothing if it is cut off from its origin, for "without a Creator the creature vanishes."

Only Christian faith as a whole constitutes the answer to this question: the goodness of creation, the drama of sin and the patient love of God who comes to meet man by his covenants, the redemptive Incarnation of his Son, his gift of the Spirit, his gathering of the Church, the power of the sacraments and his call to a blessed life  to which free creatures are invited to consent in advance, but from which, by a terrible mystery, they can also turn away in advance. /There is not a single aspect of the Christian message that is not in part an answer to the question of evil./

[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p1s2c1p7.htm#413][413]] "God did not make death, and he does not delight in the death of the living. . . It was through the devil's envy that death entered the world" ( /Wis/ 1:13; 2:24).

******** 414
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p1s2c1p7.htm#414][414]] Satan or the devil and the other demons are fallen angels who have freely refused to serve God and his plan. Their choice against God is definitive. They try to associate man in their revolt against God.

******** 415
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p1s2c1p7.htm#415][415]] "Although set by God in a state of rectitude man, enticed by the evil one, abused his freedom at the very start of history. He lifted himself up against God, and sought to attain his goal apart from him" (GS 13 § 1).

******** 416
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p1s2c1p7.htm#416][416]] By his sin Adam, as the first man, lost the original holiness and justice he had received from God, not only for himself but for all human beings.

******** 417
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p1s2c1p7.htm#417][417]] Adam and Eve transmitted to their descendants human nature wounded by their own first sin and hence deprived of original holiness and justice; this deprivation is called "original sin".

******** 418
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p1s2c1p7.htm#418][418]] As a result of original sin, human nature is weakened in its powers, subject to ignorance, suffering and the domination of death, and inclined to sin (this inclination is called "concupiscence").

******** 419
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p1s2c1p7.htm#419][419]] "We therefore hold, with the Council of Trent, that original sin is transmitted with human nature, "by propagation, not by imitation" and that it is. . . 'proper to each'" (Paul VI, /CPG/ § 16).

******** 420
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p1s2c1p7.htm#420][420]] The victory that Christ won over sin has given us greater blessings than those which sin had taken from us: "where sin increased, grace abounded all the more" ( /Rom/ 5:20).

******** 421
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p1s2c1p7.htm#421][421]] Christians believe that "the world has been established and kept in being by the Creator's love; has fallen into slavery to sin but has been set free by Christ, crucified and risen to break the power of the evil one. . ." ( /GS/ 2 § 2).

The meaning of this event is accessible only to faith, which understands in it the "connection of these mysteries with one another" [fn:713] in the totality of Christ's mysteries, from his Incarnation to his Passover. St. Ignatius of Antioch already bears witness to this connection: "Mary's virginity and giving birth, and even the Lord's death escaped the notice of the prince of this world: these three mysteries worthy of proclamation were accomplished in God's silence."

[fn:939] This is not surprising, if one recalls that on the day after Pentecost "a great many of the priests were obedient to the faith" and "some believers. . . belonged to the party of the Pharisees", to the point that St. James could tell St. Paul, "How many thousands there are among the Jews of those who have believed; and they are all zealous for the Law."

[fn:943] The Sanhedrin, having declared Jesus deserving of death as a blasphemer but having lost the right to put anyone to death, hands him over to the Romans, accusing him of political revolt, a charge that puts him in the same category as Barabbas who had been accused of sedition.

In about A.D. 56 St. Paul could already write to the Corinthians: "I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received, that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the scriptures, and that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the scriptures, and that he appeared to Cephas, then to the Twelve. . ."

[fn:1054] The first element we encounter in the framework of the Easter events is the empty tomb. In itself it is not a direct proof of Resurrection; the absence of Christ's body from the tomb could be explained otherwise. [fn:1055] Nonetheless the empty tomb was still an essential sign for all. Its discovery by the disciples was the first step toward recognizing the very fact of the Resurrection. This was the case, first with the holy women, and then with Peter. [fn:1056] The disciple "whom Jesus loved" affirmed that when he entered the empty tomb and discovered "the linen cloths lying there", "he saw and believed". [fn:1057] This suggests that he realized from the empty tomb's condition that the absence of Jesus' body could not have been of human doing and that Jesus had not simply returned to earthly life as had been the case with Lazarus.

As witnesses of the Risen One, they remain the foundation stones of his Church. The faith of the first community of believers is based on the witness of concrete men known to the Christians and for the most part still living among them.

It is clear from the facts that the disciples' faith was drastically put to the test by their master's Passion and death on the cross, which he had foretold. [fn:1064] The shock provoked by the Passion was so great that at least some of the disciples did not at once believe in the news of the Resurrection. Far from showing us a community seized by a mystical exaltation, the Gospels present us with disciples demoralized ("looking sad" [fn:1065] ) and frightened. For they had not believed the holy women returning from the tomb and had regarded their words as an "idle tale". [fn:1066] When Jesus reveals himself to the Eleven on Easter evening, "he upbraided them for their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they had not believed those who saw him after he had risen."

[fn:1069] Therefore the hypothesis that the Resurrection was produced by the apostles' faith (or credulity) will not hold up.

He invites them in this way to recognize that he is not a ghost and above all to verify that the risen body in which he appears to them is the same body that had been tortured and crucified, for it still bears the traces of his Passion. [fn:1070] Yet at the same time this authentic, real body possesses the new properties of a glorious body: not limited by space and time but able to be present how and when he wills; for Christ's humanity can no longer be confined to earth, and belongs henceforth only to the Father's divine realm. [fn:1071] For this reason too the risen Jesus enjoys the sovereign freedom of appearing as he wishes: in the guise of a gardener or in other forms familiar to his disciples, precisely to awaken their faith.

Christ's Resurrection is essentially different. In his risen body he passes from the state of death to another life beyond time and space.

 - in the Scriptures he inspired;

 - in the Tradition, to which the Church Fathers are always timely witnesses;

 - in the Church's Magisterium, which he assists;

 - in the sacramental liturgy, through its words and symbols, in which the Holy Spirit puts us into communion with Christ;

⁘[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p1s2c3a8.htm#689][689]] The One whom the Father has sent into our hearts, the Spirit of his Son, is truly God. [fn:1166] Consubstantial with the Father and the Son, the Spirit is inseparable from them, in both the inner life of the Trinity and his gift of love for the world. In adoring the Holy Trinity, life-giving, consubstantial, and indivisible, the Church's faith also professes the distinction of persons. When the Father sends his Word, he always sends his Breath. In their joint mission, the Son and the Holy Spirit are distinct but inseparable. To be sure, it is Christ who is seen, the visible image of the invisible God, but it is the Spirit who reveals him.

[fn:1167] When Christ is finally glorified, [fn:1168] he can in turn send the Spirit from his place with the Father to those who believe in him: he communicates to them his glory, [fn:1169] that is, the Holy Spirit who glorifies him. [fn:1170] From that time on, this joint mission will be manifested in the children adopted by the Father in the Body of his Son: the mission of the Spirit of adoption is to unite them to Christ and make them live in him:

 The notion of anointing suggests . . . that there is no distance between the Son and the Spirit. Indeed, just as between the surface of the body and the anointing with oil neither reason nor sensation recognizes any intermediary, so the contact of the Son with the Spirit is immediate, so that anyone who would make contact with the Son by faith must first encounter the oil by contact. In fact there is no part that is not covered by the Holy Spirit. That is why the confession of the Son's Lordship is made in the Holy Spirit by those who receive him, the Spirit coming from all sides to those who approach the Son in faith. [fn:1171]

 The term "Spirit" translates the Hebrew word /ruah/ , which, in its primary sense, means breath, air, wind. Jesus indeed uses the sensory image of the wind to suggest to Nicodemus the transcendent newness of him who is personally God's breath, the divine Spirit. [fn:1173] On the other hand, "Spirit" and "Holy" are divine attributes common to the three divine persons.  By joining the two terms, Scripture, liturgy, and theological language designate the inexpressible person of the Holy Spirit, without any possible equivocation with other uses of the terms "spirit" and "holy."

The symbolism of water signifies the Holy Spirit's action in Baptism, since after the invocation of the Holy Spirit it becomes the efficacious sacramental sign of new birth: just as the gestation of our first birth took place in water, so the water of Baptism truly signifies that our birth into the divine life is given to us in the Holy Spirit. As "by one Spirit we were all baptized," so we are also "made to drink of one Spirit." [fn:1183] Thus the Spirit is also personally the living water welling up from Christ crucified [fn:1184] as its source and welling up in us to eternal life. [fn:1185]

The symbolism of anointing with oil also signifies the Holy Spirit, [fn:1186] to the point of becoming a synonym for the Holy Spirit. In Christian initiation, anointing is the sacramental sign of Confirmation, called "chrismation" in the Churches of the East. Its full force can be grasped only in relation to the primary anointing accomplished by the Holy Spirit, that of Jesus. Christ (in Hebrew " /messiah/ ") means the one "anointed" by God's Spirit. There were several anointed ones of the Lord in the Old Covenant, pre-eminently King David. [fn:1187] But Jesus is God's Anointed in a unique way: the humanity the Son assumed was entirely anointed by the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit established him as "Christ." [fn:1188] The Virgin Mary conceived Christ by the Holy Spirit who, through the angel, proclaimed him the Christ at his birth, and prompted Simeon to come to the temple to see the Christ of the Lord. [fn:1189] The Spirit filled Christ and the power of the Spirit went out from him in his acts of healing and of saving. [fn:1190] Finally, it was the Spirit who raised Jesus from the dead. [fn:1191] Now, fully established as "Christ" in his humanity victorious over death, Jesus pours out the Holy Spirit abundantly until "the saints" constitute - in their union with the humanity of the Son of God - that perfect man "to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ": [fn:1192] "the whole Christ," in St. Augustine's expression.

While water signifies birth and the fruitfulness of life given in the Holy Spirit, fire symbolizes the transforming energy of the Holy Spirit's actions. The prayer of the prophet Elijah, who "arose like fire" and whose "word burned like a torch," brought down fire from heaven on the sacrifice on Mount Carmel. [fn:1193] This event was a "figure" of the fire of the Holy Spirit, who transforms what he touches.  John the Baptist, who goes "before [the Lord] in the spirit and power of Elijah," proclaims Christ as the one who "will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire." [fn:1194] Jesus will say of the Spirit: "I came to cast fire upon the earth; and would that it were already kindled!" [fn:1195] In the form of tongues "as of fire," the Holy Spirit rests on the disciples on the morning of Pentecost and fills them with himself [fn:1196] The spiritual tradition has retained this symbolism of fire as one of the most expressive images of the Holy Spirit's actions.

[fn:1202] In the Holy Spirit, Christ fulfills these figures. The Spirit comes upon the Virgin Mary and "overshadows" her, so that she might conceive and give birth to Jesus. [fn:1203] On the mountain of Transfiguration, the Spirit in the "cloud came and overshadowed" Jesus, Moses and Elijah, Peter, James and John, and "a voice came out of the cloud, saying, 'This is my Son, my Chosen; listen to him!'"

 - It is the People /of God/ : God is not the property of any one people. But he acquired a people for himself from those who previously were not a people: "a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation." [fn:1358]

 - One becomes a /member/ of this people not by a physical birth, but by being "born anew," a birth "of water and the Spirit," [fn:1359] that is, by faith in Christ, and Baptism.

 - This People has for its Head Jesus the Christ (the anointed, the Messiah). Because the same anointing, the Holy Spirit, flows from the head into the body, this is "the messianic people."

 - "The /status/ of this people is that of the dignity and freedom of the sons of God, in whose hearts the Holy Spirit dwells as in a temple."

 - "Its /law/ is the new commandment to love as Christ loved us." [fn:1360] This is the "new" law of the Holy Spirit. [fn:1361]

 - Its /mission/ is to be salt of the earth and light of the world. [fn:1362] This people is "a most sure seed of unity, hope, and salvation for the whole human race."

 - Its /destiny/ , finally, "is the Kingdom of God which has been begun by God himself on earth and which must be further extended until it has been brought to perfection by him at the end of time." [fn:1363]

 First, the Church is catholic because Christ is present in her. "Where there is Christ Jesus, there is the Catholic Church."

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
 Basing itself on Scripture and Tradition, the Council teaches that the Church, a pilgrim now on earth, is necessary for salvation: the one Christ is the mediator and the way of salvation; he is present to us in his body which is the Church. He himself explicitly asserted the necessity of faith and Baptism, and thereby affirmed at the same time the necessity of the Church which men enter through Baptism as through a door. Hence they could not be saved who, knowing that the Catholic Church was founded as necessary by God through Christ, would refuse either to enter it or to remain in it. [fn:1492]

[fn:1766] The Church also commends almsgiving, indulgences, and works of penance undertaken on behalf of the dead:

But we cannot love God if we sin gravely against him, against our neighbor or against ourselves: "He who does not love remains in death. Anyone who hates his brother is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him."

[fn:1769] To die in mortal sin without repenting and accepting God's merciful love means remaining separated from him for ever by our own free choice.

In it full public worship is performed by the Mystical Body of Jesus Christ, that is, by the Head and his members. From this it follows that every liturgical celebration, because it is an action of Christ the priest and of his Body which is the Church, is a sacred action surpassing all others. No other action of the Church can equal its efficacy by the same title and to the same degree. [fn:1815]

The covenant with Noah and with all living things renewed this blessing of fruitfulness despite man's sin which had brought a curse on the ground.

In its characteristic structure the Liturgy of the Word originates in Jewish prayer. The Liturgy of the Hours and other liturgical texts and formularies, as well as those of our most venerable prayers, including the Lord's Prayer, have parallels in Jewish prayer. The Eucharistic Prayers also draw their inspiration from the Jewish tradition. The relationship between Jewish liturgy and Christian liturgy, but also their differences in content, are particularly evident in the great feasts of the liturgical year, such as Passover.

****** IN BRIEF
******** 1187
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p2s1c2a1.htm#1187][1187]] The liturgy is the work of the whole Christ, head and body. Our high priest celebrates it unceasingly in the heavenly liturgy, with the holy Mother of God, the apostles, all the saints, and the multitude of those who have already entered the kingdom.

******** 1188
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p2s1c2a1.htm#1188][1188]] In a liturgical celebration, the whole assembly is /leitourgos/ , each member according to his own function. The baptismal priesthood is that of the whole Body of Christ. But some of the faithful are ordained through the sacrament of Holy Orders to represent Christ as head of the Body.

******** 1189
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p2s1c2a1.htm#1189][1189]] The liturgical celebration involves signs and symbols relating to creation (candles, water, fire), human life (washing, anointing, breaking bread) and the history of salvation (the rites of the Passover). Integrated into the world of faith and taken up by the power of the Holy Spirit, these cosmic elements, human rituals, and gestures of remembrance of God become bearers of the saving and sanctifying action of Christ.

******** 1190
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p2s1c2a1.htm#1190][1190]] The Liturgy of the Word is an integral part of the celebration. The meaning of the celebration is expressed by the Word of God which is proclaimed and by the response of faith to it.

******** 1191
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p2s1c2a1.htm#1191][1191]] Song and music are closely connected with the liturgical action. The criteria for their proper use are the beauty expressive of prayer, the unanimous participation of the assembly, and the sacred character of the celebration.

******** 1192
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p2s1c2a1.htm#1192][1192]] Sacred images in our churches and homes are intended to awaken and nourish our faith in the mystery of Christ. Through the icon of Christ and his works of salvation, it is he whom we adore. Through sacred images of the holy Mother of God, of the angels and of the saints, we venerate the persons represented.

******** 1193
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p2s1c2a1.htm#1193][1193]] Sunday, the "Lord's Day," is the principal day for the celebration of the Eucharist because it is the day of the Resurrection. It is the pre-eminent day of the liturgical assembly, the day of the Christian family, and the day of joy and rest from work. Sunday is "the foundation and kernel of the whole liturgical year" ( /SC/ 106).

******** 1194
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p2s1c2a1.htm#1194][1194]] The Church, "in the course of the year, . . . unfolds the whole mystery of Christ from his Incarnation and Nativity through his Ascension, to Pentecost and the expectation of the blessed hope of the coming of the Lord" ( /SC/ 102 § 2).

******** 1195
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p2s1c2a1.htm#1195][1195]] By keeping the memorials of the saints - first of all the holy Mother of God, then the apostles, the martyrs, and other saints - on fixed days of the liturgical year, the Church on earth shows that she is united with the liturgy of heaven. She gives glory to Christ for having accomplished his salvation in his glorified members; their example encourages her on her way to the Father.

******** 1196
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p2s1c2a1.htm#1196][1196]] The faithful who celebrate the Liturgy of the Hours are united to Christ our high priest, by the prayer of the Psalms, meditation on the Word of God, and canticles and blessings, in order to be joined with his unceasing and universal prayer that gives glory to the Father and implores the gift of the Holy Spirit on the whole world.

******** 1197
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p2s1c2a1.htm#1197][1197]] Christ is the true temple of God, "the place where his glory dwells"; by the grace of God, Christians also become the temples of the Holy Spirit, living stones out of which the Church is built.

******** 1198
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p2s1c2a1.htm#1198][1198]] In its earthly state the Church needs places where the community can gather together. Our visible churches, holy places, are images of the holy city, the heavenly Jerusalem, toward which we are making our way on pilgrimage.

******** 1199
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p2s1c2a1.htm#1199][1199]] It is in these churches that the Church celebrates public worship to the glory of the Holy Trinity, hears the word of God and sings his praise, lifts up her prayer, and offers the sacrifice of Christ sacramentally present in the midst of the assembly. These churches are also places of recollection and personal prayer.

Through the liturgical life of a local church, Christ, the light and salvation of all peoples, is made manifest to the particular people and culture to which that Church is sent and in which she is rooted. The Church is catholic, capable of integrating into her unity, while purifying them, all the authentic riches of cultures. [fn:1948]

******** 1207
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p2s1c2a2.htm#1207][1207]] It is fitting that liturgical celebration tends to express itself in the culture of the people where the Church finds herself, though without being submissive to it. Moreover, the liturgy itself generates cultures and shapes them.

******** 1208
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p2s1c2a2.htm#1208][1208]] The diverse liturgical traditions or rites, legitimately recognized, manifest the catholicity of the Church, because they signify and communicate the same mystery of Christ.

******** 1209
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p2s1c2a2.htm#1209][1209]] The criterion that assures unity amid the diversity of liturgical traditions is fidelity to apostolic Tradition, i.e., the communion in the faith and the sacraments received from the apostles, a communion that is both signified and guaranteed by apostolic succession.

There are seven: Baptism, Confirmation (or Chrismation), the Eucharist, Penance, the Anointing of the Sick, Holy Orders and Matrimony. The seven sacraments touch all the stages and all the important moments of Christian life: [fn:1955] they give birth and increase, healing and mission to the Christian's life of faith. There is thus a certain resemblance between the stages of natural life and the stages of the spiritual life.

****** III. How Is the Sacrament of Baptism Celebrated?
******* Christian Initiation
******** 1229
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p2s2c1a1.htm#1229][1229]] From the time of the apostles, becoming a Christian has been accomplished by a journey and initiation in several stages. This journey can be covered rapidly or slowly, but certain essential elements will always have to be present: proclamation of the Word, acceptance of the Gospel entailing conversion, profession of faith, Baptism itself, the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, and admission to Eucharistic communion.

******** 1230
⁘[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p2s2c1a1.htm#1230][1230]] This initiation has varied greatly through the centuries according to circumstances. In the first centuries of the Church, Christian initiation saw considerable development. A long period of /catechumenate/ included a series of preparatory rites, which were liturgical landmarks along the path of catechumenal preparation and culminated in the celebration of the sacraments of Christian initiation.

By its very nature infant Baptism requires a /post-baptismal catechumenate/ .

****** IN BRIEF
******** 1275
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p2s2c1a1.htm#1275][1275]] Christian initiation is accomplished by three sacraments together: Baptism which is the beginning of new life; Confirmation which is its strengthening; and the Eucharist which nourishes the disciple with Christ's Body and Blood for his transformation in Christ.

******** 1276
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p2s2c1a1.htm#1276][1276]] "Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you" ( /Mt/ 28:19-20).

******** 1277
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p2s2c1a1.htm#1277][1277]] Baptism is birth into the new life in Christ. In accordance with the Lord's will, it is necessary for salvation, as is the Church herself, which we enter by Baptism.

******** 1278
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p2s2c1a1.htm#1278][1278]] The essential rite of Baptism consists in immersing the candidate in water or pouring water on his head, while pronouncing the invocation of the Most Holy Trinity: the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

******** 1279
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p2s2c1a1.htm#1279][1279]] The fruit of Baptism, or baptismal grace, is a rich reality that includes forgiveness of original sin and all personal sins, birth into the new life by which man becomes an adoptive son of the Father, a member of Christ and a temple of the Holy Spirit. By this very fact the person baptized is incorporated into the Church, the Body of Christ, and made a sharer in the priesthood of Christ.

******** 1280
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p2s2c1a1.htm#1280][1280]] Baptism imprints on the soul an indelible spiritual sign, the character, which consecrates the baptized person for Christian worship. Because of the character Baptism cannot be repeated (cf. DS 1609 and DS 1624).

******** 1281
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p2s2c1a1.htm#1281][1281]] Those who die for the faith, those who are catechumens, and all those who, without knowing of the Church but acting under the inspiration of grace, seek God sincerely and strive to fulfill his will, can be saved even if they have not been baptized (cf. /LG/ 16).

******** 1282
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p2s2c1a1.htm#1282][1282]] Since the earliest times, Baptism has been administered to children, for it is a grace and a gift of God that does not presuppose any human merit; children are baptized in the faith of the Church. Entry into Christian life gives access to true freedom.

******** 1283
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p2s2c1a1.htm#1283][1283]] With respect to children who have died without Baptism, the liturgy of the Church invites us to trust in God's mercy and to pray for their salvation.

******** 1284
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p2s2c1a1.htm#1284][1284]] In case of necessity, any person can baptize provided that he have the intention of doing that which the Church does and provided that he pours water on the candidate's head while saying: "I baptize you in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit."

******** 1290
⁘[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p2s2c1a2.htm#1290][1290]] In the first centuries Confirmation generally comprised one single celebration with Baptism, forming with it a "double sacrament," according to the expression of St. Cyprian. Among other reasons, the multiplication of infant baptisms all through the year, the increase of rural parishes, and the growth of dioceses often prevented the bishop from being present at all baptismal celebrations. In the West the desire to reserve the completion of Baptism to the bishop caused the temporal separation of the two sacraments. The East has kept them united, so that Confirmation is conferred by the priest who baptizes. But he can do so only with the "myron" consecrated by a bishop. [fn:2055]

The first anointing of the neophyte on coming out of the baptismal bath was performed by the priest; it was completed by a second anointing on the forehead of the newly baptized by the bishop. [fn:2056] The first anointing with sacred chrism, by the priest, has remained attached to the baptismal rite; it signifies the participation of the one baptized in the prophetic, priestly, and kingly offices of Christ. If Baptism is conferred on an adult, there is only one post-baptismal anointing, that of Confirmation.

******** 1293
⁘[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p2s2c1a2.htm#1293][1293]] In treating the rite of Confirmation, it is fitting to consider the sign of /anointing/ and what it signifies and imprints: a spiritual /seal/ .

 Anointing, in Biblical and other ancient symbolism, is rich in meaning: oil is a sign of abundance and joy; [fn:2057] it cleanses (anointing before and after a bath) and limbers (the anointing of athletes and wrestlers); oil is a sign of healing, since it is soothing to bruises and wounds; [fn:2058] and it makes radiant with beauty, health, and strength.

******** 1294
⁘[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p2s2c1a2.htm#1294][1294]] Anointing with oil has all these meanings in the sacramental life. The pre-baptismal anointing with the oil of catechumens signifies cleansing and strengthening; the anointing of the sick expresses healing and comfort. The post-baptismal anointing with sacred chrism in Confirmation and ordination is the sign of consecration. By Confirmation Christians, that is, those who are anointed, share more completely in the mission of Jesus Christ and the fullness of the Holy Spirit with which he is filled, so that their lives may give off "the aroma of Christ."

A seal is a symbol of a person, a sign of personal authority, or ownership of an object. [fn:2060] Hence soldiers were marked with their leader's seal and slaves with their master's.

It is the bishop who, in the course of the Chrism Mass of Holy Thursday, consecrates the sacred chrism for his whole diocese. In some Eastern Churches this consecration is even reserved to the patriarch:

 In the East, ordinarily the priest who baptizes also immediately confers Confirmation in one and the same celebration. But he does so with sacred chrism consecrated by the patriarch or the bishop, thus expressing the apostolic unity of the Church whose bonds are strengthened by the sacrament of Confirmation. In the Latin Church, the same discipline applies to the Baptism of adults or to the reception into full communion with the Church of a person baptized in another Christian community that does not have valid Confirmation.

Bishops are the successors of the apostles. They have received the fullness of the sacrament of Holy Orders. The administration of this sacrament by them demonstrates clearly that its effect is to unite those who receive it more closely to the Church, to her apostolic origins, and to her mission of bearing witness to Christ.

******** 1315
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p2s2c1a2.htm#1315][1315]] "Now when the apostles at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent to them Peter and John, who came down and prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Spirit; for it had not yet fallen on any of them, but they had only been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. Then they laid their hands on them and they received the Holy Spirit" ( /Acts/ 8:14-17).

******** 1316
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p2s2c1a2.htm#1316][1316]] Confirmation perfects Baptismal grace; it is the sacrament which gives the Holy Spirit in order to root us more deeply in the divine filiation, incorporate us more firmly into Christ, strengthen our bond with the Church, associate us more closely with her mission, and help us bear witness to the Christian faith in words accompanied by deeds.

******** 1317
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p2s2c1a2.htm#1317][1317]] Confirmation, like Baptism, imprints a spiritual mark or indelible character on the Christian's soul; for this reason one can receive this sacrament only once in one's life.

******** 1318
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p2s2c1a2.htm#1318][1318]] In the East this sacrament is administered immediately after Baptism and is followed by participation in the Eucharist; this tradition highlights the unity of the three sacraments of Christian initiation. In the Latin Church this sacrament is administered when the age of reason has been reached, and its celebration is ordinarily reserved to the bishop, thus signifying that this sacrament strengthens the ecclesial bond.

******** 1319
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p2s2c1a2.htm#1319][1319]] A candidate for Confirmation who has attained the age of reason must profess the faith, be in the state of grace, have the intention of receiving the sacrament, and be prepared to assume the role of disciple and witness to Christ, both within the ecclesial community and in temporal affairs.

******** 1320
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p2s2c1a2.htm#1320][1320]] The essential rite of Confirmation is anointing the forehead of the baptized with sacred chrism (in the East other sense-organs as well), together with the laying on of the minister's hand and the words: /"Accipe signaculum doni Spiritus Sancti"/ (Be sealed with the Gift of the Holy Spirit.) in the Roman rite, or: /Signaculum doni Spiritus Sancti/ [the seal of the gift of the Holy Spirit] in the Byzantine rite.

******** 1321
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p2s2c1a2.htm#1321][1321]] When Confirmation is celebrated separately from Baptism, its connection with Baptism is expressed, among other ways, by the renewal of baptismal promises.

 Eucharist, because it is an action of thanksgiving to God. The Greek words /eucharistein/ [fn:2095] and /eulogein/ [fn:2096] recall the Jewish blessings that proclaim - especially during a meal - God's works: creation, redemption, and sanctification.

 The /Breaking of Bread/ , because Jesus used this rite, part of a Jewish meal, when as master of the table he blessed and distributed the bread, [fn:2098] above all at the Last Supper. [fn:2099] It is by this action that his disciples will recognize him after his Resurrection, [fn:2100] and it is this expression that the first Christians will use to designate their Eucharistic assemblies; [fn:2101] by doing so they signified that all who eat the one broken bread, Christ, enter into communion with him and form but one body in him.

Faithful to the Lord's command the Church continues to do, in his memory and until his glorious return, what he did on the eve of his Passion: "He took bread. . . ." "He took the cup filled with wine. . . ." The signs of bread and wine become, in a way surpassing understanding, the Body and Blood of Christ; they continue also to signify the goodness of creation. Thus in the Offertory we give thanks to the Creator for bread and wine, [fn:2108] fruit of the "work of human hands," but above all as "fruit of the earth" and "of the vine" - gifts of the Creator. The Church sees in the gesture of the king-priest Melchizedek, who "brought out bread and wine," a prefiguring of her own offering. [fn:2109]

But they also received a new significance in the context of the Exodus: the unleavened bread that Israel eats every year at Passover commemorates the haste of the departure that liberated them from Egypt; the remembrance of the manna in the desert will always recall to Israel that it lives by the bread of the Word of God; [fn:2110] their daily bread is the fruit of the promised land, the pledge of God's faithfulness to his promises. The "cup of blessing" [fn:2111] at the end of the Jewish Passover meal adds to the festive joy of wine an eschatological dimension: the messianic expectation of the rebuilding of Jerusalem.

It displays two great parts that form a fundamental unity: - the gathering, the liturgy of the Word, with readings, homily and general intercessions; - the liturgy of the Eucharist, with the presentation of the bread and wine, the consecratory thanksgiving, and communion.

 The liturgy of the Word and liturgy of the Eucharist together form "one single act of worship"; [fn:2126] the Eucharistic table set for us is the table both of the Word of God and of the Body of the Lord. [fn:2127]

Since Christ was about to take his departure from his own in his visible form, he wanted to give us his sacramental presence; since he was about to offer himself on the cross to save us, he wanted us to have the memorial of the love with which he loved us "to the end," [fn:2163] even to the giving of his life. In his Eucharistic presence he remains mysteriously in our midst as the one who loved us and gave himself up for us, [fn:2164] and he remains under signs that express and communicate this love:

 The Church and the world have a great need for Eucharistic worship. Jesus awaits us in this sacrament of love. Let us not refuse the time to go to meet him in adoration, in contemplation full of faith, and open to making amends for the serious offenses and crimes of the world. Let our adoration never cease.

But the celebration of the Eucharistic sacrifice is wholly directed toward the intimate union of the faithful with Christ through communion.

⁘[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p2s2c1a3.htm#1383][1383]] /The altar/ , around which the Church is gathered in the celebration of the Eucharist, represents the two aspects of the same mystery: the altar of the sacrifice and the table of the Lord. This is all the more so since the Christian altar is the symbol of Christ himself, present in the midst of the assembly of his faithful, both as the victim offered for our reconciliation and as food from heaven who is giving himself to us. "For what is the altar of Christ if not the image of the Body of Christ?" [fn:2168] asks St. Ambrose. He says elsewhere, "The altar represents the body [of Christ] and the Body of Christ is on the altar." [fn:2169] The liturgy expresses this unity of sacrifice and communion in many prayers. Thus the Roman Church prays in its anaphora:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE

******** 1407
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p2s2c1a3.htm#1407][1407]] The Eucharist is the heart and the summit of the Church's life, for in it Christ associates his Church and all her members with his sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving offered once for all on the cross to his Father; by this sacrifice he pours out the graces of salvation on his Body which is the Church.

******** 1408

[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p2s2c1a3.htm#1413][1413]] By the consecration the transubstantiation of the bread and wine into the Body and Blood of Christ is brought about.

[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p2s2c1a3.htm#1418][1418]] Because Christ himself is present in the sacrament of the altar, he is to be honored with the worship of adoration. "To visit the Blessed Sacrament is . . . a proof of gratitude, an expression of love, and a duty of adoration toward Christ our Lord" (Paul VI, /MF/ 66).

[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p2s2c1a3.htm#1419][1419]] Having passed from this world to the Father, Christ gives us in the Eucharist the pledge of glory with him. Participation in the Holy Sacrifice identifies us with his Heart, sustains our strength along the pilgrimage of this life, makes us long for eternal life, and unites us even now to the Church in heaven, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all the saints.

 It is called the /sacrament of Reconciliation/ , because it imparts to the sinner the love of God who reconciles: "Be reconciled to God." [fn:2210] He who lives by God's merciful love is ready to respond to the Lord's call: "Go; first be reconciled to your brother." [fn:2211]

******** 1447
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p2s2c2a4.htm#1447][1447]] Over the centuries the concrete form in which the Church has exercised this power received from the Lord has varied considerably. During the first centuries the reconciliation of Christians who had committed particularly grave sins after their Baptism (for example, idolatry, murder, or adultery) was tied to a very rigorous discipline, according to which penitents had to do public penance for their sins, often for years, before receiving reconciliation. To this "order of penitents" (which concerned only certain grave sins), one was only rarely admitted and in certain regions only once in a lifetime. During the seventh century Irish missionaries, inspired by the Eastern monastic tradition, took to continental Europe the "private" practice of penance, which does not require public and prolonged completion of penitential works before reconciliation with the Church. From that time on, the sacrament has been performed in secret between penitent and priest. This new practice envisioned the possibility of repetition and so opened the way to a regular frequenting of this sacrament. It allowed the forgiveness of grave sins and venial sins to be integrated into one sacramental celebration. In its main lines this is the form of penance that the Church has practiced down to our day.

It comprises two equally essential elements: on the one hand, the acts of the man who undergoes conversion through the action of the Holy Spirit: namely, contrition, confession, and satisfaction; on the other, God's action through the intervention of the Church. The Church, who through the bishop and his priests forgives sins in the name of Jesus Christ and determines the manner of satisfaction, also prays for the sinner and does penance with him. Thus the sinner is healed and re-established in ecclesial communion.

This purification frees one from what is called the "temporal punishment" of sin. These two punishments must not be conceived of as a kind of vengeance inflicted by God from without, but as following from the very nature of sin.

While patiently bearing sufferings and trials of all kinds and, when the day comes, serenely facing death, the Christian must strive to accept this temporal punishment of sin as a grace. He should strive by works of mercy and charity, as well as by prayer and the various practices of penance, to put off completely the "old man" and to put on the "new man." [fn:2310]

****** XI. The Celebration of the Sacrament of Penance
******** 1480
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p2s2c2a4.htm#1480][1480]] Like all the sacraments, Penance is a liturgical action. The elements of the celebration are ordinarily these: a greeting and blessing from the priest, reading the word of God to illuminate the conscience and elicit contrition, and an exhortation to repentance; the confession, which acknowledges sins and makes them known to the priest; the imposition and acceptance of a penance; the priest's absolution; a prayer of thanksgiving and praise and dismissal with the blessing of the priest.

******** 1481
⁘[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p2s2c2a4.htm#1481][1481]] The Byzantine Liturgy recognizes several formulas of absolution, in the form of invocation, which admirably express the mystery of forgiveness: "May the same God, who through the Prophet Nathan forgave David when he confessed his sins, who forgave Peter when he wept bitterly, the prostitute when she washed his feet with her tears, the publican, and the prodigal son, through me, a sinner, forgive you both in this life and in the next and enable you to appear before his awe-inspiring tribunal without condemnation, he who is blessed for ever and ever.

Here, the personal confession of sins and individual absolution are inserted into a liturgy of the word of God with readings and a homily, an examination of conscience conducted in common, a communal request for forgiveness, the Our Father and a thanksgiving in common. This communal celebration expresses more clearly the ecclesial character of penance. However, regardless of its manner of celebration the sacrament of Penance is always, by its very nature, a liturgical action, and therefore an ecclesial and public action. [fn:2316]

Grave necessity of this sort can arise when there is imminent danger of death without sufficient time for the priest or priests to hear each penitent's confession. Grave necessity can also exist when, given the number of penitents, there are not enough confessors to hear individual confessions properly in a reasonable time, so that the penitents through no fault of their own would be deprived of sacramental grace or Holy Communion for a long time. In this case, for the absolution to be valid the faithful must have the intention of individually confessing their grave sins in the time required. [fn:2317] The diocesan bishop is the judge of whether or not the conditions required for general absolution exist. [fn:2318] A large gathering of the faithful on the occasion of major feasts or pilgrimages does not constitute a case of grave necessity. [fn:2319]

[fn:2320] There are profound reasons for this. Christ is at work in each of the sacraments. He personally addresses every sinner: "My son, your sins are forgiven." [fn:2321] He is the physician tending each one of the sick who need him to cure them. [fn:2322] He raises them up and reintegrates them into fraternal communion.

"He breathed on them, and said to them: 'Receive the Holy Spirit. If you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven; if you retain the sins of any, they are retained"' ( /Jn/ 20:19, 22-23).

******** 1486
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p2s2c2a4.htm#1486][1486]] The forgiveness of sins committed after Baptism is conferred by a particular sacrament called the sacrament of conversion, confession, penance, or reconciliation.

******** 1487
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p2s2c2a4.htm#1487][1487]] The sinner wounds God's honor and love, his own human dignity as a man called to be a son of God, and the spiritual well-being of the Church, of which each Christian ought to be a living stone.

******** 1488
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p2s2c2a4.htm#1488][1488]] To the eyes of faith no evil is graver than sin and nothing has worse consequences for sinners themselves, for the Church, and for the whole world.

******** 1489
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p2s2c2a4.htm#1489][1489]] To return to communion with God after having lost it through sin is a process born of the grace of God who is rich in mercy and solicitous for the salvation of men. One must ask for this precious gift for oneself and for others.

******** 1490
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p2s2c2a4.htm#1490][1490]] The movement of return to God, called conversion and repentance, entails sorrow for and abhorrence of sins committed, and the firm purpose of sinning no more in the future. Conversion touches the past and the future and is nourished by hope in God's mercy.

******** 1491
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p2s2c2a4.htm#1491][1491]] The sacrament of Penance is a whole consisting in three actions of the penitent and the priest's absolution. The penitent's acts are repentance, confession or disclosure of sins to the priest, and the intention to make reparation and do works of reparation.

******** 1492
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p2s2c2a4.htm#1492][1492]] Repentance (also called contrition) must be inspired by motives that arise from faith. If repentance arises from love of charity for God, it is called "perfect" contrition; if it is founded on other motives, it is called "imperfect."

******** 1493
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p2s2c2a4.htm#1493][1493]] One who desires to obtain reconciliation with God and with the Church, must confess to a priest all the unconfessed grave sins he remembers after having carefully examined his conscience. The confession of venial faults, without being necessary in itself, is nevertheless strongly recommended by the Church.

******** 1494
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p2s2c2a4.htm#1494][1494]] The confessor proposes the performance of certain acts of "satisfaction" or "penance" to be performed by the penitent in order to repair the harm caused by sin and to re-establish habits befitting a disciple of Christ.

******** 1495
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p2s2c2a4.htm#1495][1495]] Only priests who have received the faculty of absolving from the authority of the Church can forgive sins in the name of Christ.

******** 1496
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p2s2c2a4.htm#1496][1496]] The spiritual effects of the sacrament of Penance are: - reconciliation with God by which the penitent recovers grace; - reconciliation with the Church; - remission of the eternal punishment incurred by mortal sins; - remission, at least in part, of temporal punishments resulting from sin; - peace and serenity of conscience, and spiritual consolation; - an increase of spiritual strength for the Christian battle.

******** 1497
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p2s2c2a4.htm#1497][1497]] Individual and integral confession of grave sins followed by absolution remains the only ordinary means of reconciliation with God and with the Church.

⁘[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p2s2c2a5.htm#1517][1517]] Like all the sacraments the Anointing of the Sick is a liturgical and communal celebration, [fn:2357] whether it takes place in the family home, a hospital or church, for a single sick person or a whole group of sick persons. It is very fitting to celebrate it within the Eucharist, the memorial of the Lord's Passover. If circumstances suggest it, the celebration of the sacrament can be preceded by the sacrament of Penance and followed by the sacrament of the Eucharist. As the sacrament of Christ's Passover the Eucharist should always be the last sacrament of the earthly journey, the "viaticum" for "passing over" to eternal life.

******** 1518
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p2s2c2a5.htm#1518][1518]] Word and sacrament form an indivisible whole. The Liturgy of the Word, preceded by an act of repentance, opens the celebration. The words of Christ, the witness of the apostles, awaken the faith of the sick person and of the community to ask the Lord for the strength of his Spirit.

******** 1519
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p2s2c2a5.htm#1519][1519]] The celebration of the sacrament includes the following principal elements: the "priests of the Church" [fn:2358] - in silence - lay hands on the sick; they pray over them in the faith of the Church [fn:2359] - this is the epiclesis proper to this sacrament; they then anoint them with oil blessed, if possible, by the bishop.

 These liturgical actions indicate what grace this sacrament confers upon the sick.

****** IV. The Effects of the Celebration of This Sacrament
******** 1520
⁘[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p2s2c2a5.htm#1520][1520]] /A particular gift of the Holy Spirit/ . The first grace of this sacrament is one of strengthening, peace and courage to overcome the difficulties that go with the condition of serious illness or the frailty of old age. This grace is a gift of the Holy Spirit, who renews trust and faith in God and strengthens against the temptations of the evil one, the temptation to discouragement and anguish in the face of death. [fn:2360] This assistance from the Lord by the power of his Spirit is meant to lead the sick person to healing of the soul, but also of the body if such is God's will. [fn:2361] Furthermore, "if he has committed sins, he will be forgiven." [fn:2362]

******** 1521
⁘[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p2s2c2a5.htm#1521][1521]] /Union with the passion of Christ/ . By the grace of this sacrament the sick person receives the strength and the gift of uniting himself more closely to Christ's Passion: in a certain way he is consecrated to bear fruit by configuration to the Savior's redemptive Passion. Suffering, a consequence of original sin, acquires a new meaning; it becomes a participation in the saving work of Jesus.

⁘[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p2s2c2a5.htm#1522][1522]] /An ecclesial grace/ . The sick who receive this sacrament, "by freely uniting themselves to the passion and death of Christ," "contribute to the good of the People of God." [fn:2363] By celebrating this sacrament the Church, in the communion of saints, intercedes for the benefit of the sick person, and he, for his part, through the grace of this sacrament, contributes to the sanctification of the Church and to the good of all men for whom the Church suffers and offers herself through Christ to God the Father.

******** 1523
⁘[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p2s2c2a5.htm#1523][1523]] /A preparation for the final journey/ . If the sacrament of anointing of the sick is given to all who suffer from serious illness and infirmity, even more rightly is it given to those at the point of departing this life; so it is also called /sacramentum exeuntium/ (the sacrament of those departing). [fn:2364] The Anointing of the Sick completes our conformity to the death and Resurrection of Christ, just as Baptism began it. It completes the holy anointings that mark the whole Christian life: that of Baptism which sealed the new life in us, and that of Confirmation which strengthened us for the combat of this life. This last anointing fortifies the end of our earthly life like a solid rampart for the final struggles before entering the Father's house. [fn:2365]

****** V. Viaticum, the Last Sacrament of the Christian
******** 1524
⁘[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p2s2c2a5.htm#1524][1524]] In addition to the Anointing of the Sick, the Church offers those who are about to leave this life the Eucharist as viaticum. Communion in the body and blood of Christ, received at this moment of "passing over" to the Father, has a particular significance and importance. It is the seed of eternal life and the power of resurrection, according to the words of the Lord: "He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day." [fn:2366] The sacrament of Christ once dead and now risen, the Eucharist is here the sacrament of passing over from death to life, from this world to the Father. [fn:2367]

****** IN BRIEF
******** 1526
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p2s2c2a5.htm#1526][1526]] "Is any among you sick? Let him call for the presbyters of the Church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord; and the prayer of faith will save the sick man, and the Lord will raise him up; and if he has committed sins, he will be forgiven" ( /Jas/ 5:14-15).

******** 1527
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p2s2c2a5.htm#1527][1527]] The sacrament of Anointing of the Sick has as its purpose the conferral of a special grace on the Christian experiencing the difficulties inherent in the condition of grave illness or old age.

******** 1528
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p2s2c2a5.htm#1528][1528]] The proper time for receiving this holy anointing has certainly arrived when the believer begins to be in danger of death because of illness or old age.

******** 1529
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p2s2c2a5.htm#1529][1529]] Each time a Christian falls seriously ill, he may receive the Anointing of the Sick, and also when, after he has received it, the illness worsens.

******** 1530
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p2s2c2a5.htm#1530][1530]] Only priests (presbyters and bishops) can give the sacrament of the Anointing of the Sick, using oil blessed by the bishop, or if necessary by the celebrating presbyter himself.

******** 1531
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p2s2c2a5.htm#1531][1531]] The celebration of the Anointing of the Sick consists essentially in the anointing of the forehead and hands of the sick person (in the Roman Rite) or of other parts of the body (in the Eastern rite), the anointing being accompanied by the liturgical prayer of the celebrant asking for the special grace of this sacrament.

******** 1532
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p2s2c2a5.htm#1532][1532]] The special grace of the sacrament of the Anointing of the Sick has as its effects: - the uniting of the sick person to the passion of Christ, for his own good and that of the whole Church; - the strengthening, peace, and courage to endure in a Christian manner the sufferings of illness or old age; - the forgiveness of sins, if the sick person was not able to obtain it through the sacrament of Penance; - the restoration of health, if it is conducive to the salvation of his soul; - the preparation for passing over to eternal life.

******** 1536
⁘[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p2s2c3a6.htm#1536][1536]] Holy Orders is the sacrament through which the mission entrusted by Christ to his apostles continues to be exercised in the Church until the end of time: thus it is the sacrament of apostolic ministry. It includes three degrees: episcopate, presbyterate, and diaconate.

****** I. Why Is This Sacrament Called "Orders"?
******** 1537
⁘[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p2s2c3a6.htm#1537][1537]] The word /order/ in Roman antiquity designated an established civil body, especially a governing body. /Ordinatio/ means incorporation into an /ordo/ . In the Church there are established bodies which Tradition, not without a basis in Sacred Scripture, [fn:2371] has since ancient times called /taxeis/ (Greek) or /ordines/ . And so the liturgy speaks of the /ordo episcoporum/ , the /ordo presbyterorum/ , the /ordo diaconorum/ . Other groups also receive this name of ordo: catechumens, virgins, spouses, widows,. . . .

:end:

******** 1538
⁘[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p2s2c3a6.htm#1538][1538]] Integration into one of these bodies in the Church was accomplished by a rite called /ordinatio/ , a religious and liturgical act which was a consecration, a blessing or a sacrament. Today the word " /ordination/ " is reserved for the sacramental act which integrates a man into the order of bishops, presbyters, or deacons, and goes beyond a simple /election, designation, delegation, or institution/ by the community, for it confers a gift of the Holy Spirit that permits the exercise of a "sacred power" ( /sacra potestas/ ) [fn:2372] which can come only from Christ himself through his Church. Ordination is also called /consecratio/ , for it is a setting apart and an investiture by Christ himself for his Church. The /laying on of hands/ by the bishop, with the consecratory prayer, constitutes the visible sign of this ordination.

He is] the defender of truth, who stands with angels, gives glory with archangels, causes sacrifices to rise to the altar on high, shares Christ's priesthood, refashions creation, restores it in God's image, recreates it for the world on high and, even greater, is divinized and divinizes.

****** IN BRIEF
******** 1590
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p2s2c3a6.htm#1590][1590]] St. Paul said to his disciple Timothy: "I remind you to rekindle the gift of God that is within you through the laying on of my hands" ( /2 Tim/ 1:6), and "If any one aspires to the office of bishop, he desires a noble task." ( /1 Tim/ 3:1) To Titus he said: "This is why I left you in Crete, that you amend what was defective, and appoint presbyters in every town, as I directed you" ( /Titus/ 1:5).

******** 1591
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p2s2c3a6.htm#1591][1591]] The whole Church is a priestly people. Through Baptism all the faithful share in the priesthood of Christ. This participation is called the "common priesthood of the faithful." Based on this common priesthood and ordered to its service, there exists another participation in the mission of Christ: the ministry conferred by the sacrament of Holy Orders, where the task is to serve in the name and in the person of Christ the Head in the midst of the community.

******** 1592
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p2s2c3a6.htm#1592][1592]] The ministerial priesthood differs in essence from the common priesthood of the faithful because it confers a sacred power for the service of the faithful. The ordained ministers exercise their service for the People of God by teaching ( /munus docendi/ ), divine worship ( /munus liturgicum/ ) and pastoral governance ( /munus regendi/ ).

******** 1593
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p2s2c3a6.htm#1593][1593]] Since the beginning, the ordained ministry has been conferred and exercised in three degrees: that of bishops, that of presbyters, and that of deacons. The ministries conferred by ordination are irreplaceable for the organic structure of the Church: without the bishop, presbyters, and deacons, one cannot speak of the Church (cf. St. Ignatius of Antioch, /Ad Trall/ . 3,1).

******** 1594
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p2s2c3a6.htm#1594][1594]] The bishop receives the fullness of the sacrament of Holy Orders, which integrates him into the episcopal college and makes him the visible head of the particular Church entrusted to him. As successors of the apostles and members of the college, the bishops share in the apostolic responsibility and mission of the whole Church under the authority of the Pope, successor of St. Peter.

******** 1595
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p2s2c3a6.htm#1595][1595]] Priests are united with the bishops in sacerdotal dignity and at the same time depend on them in the exercise of their pastoral functions; they are called to be the bishops' prudent co-workers. They form around their bishop the presbyterium which bears responsibility with him for the particular Church. They receive from the bishop the charge of a parish community or a determinate ecclesial office.

******** 1596
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p2s2c3a6.htm#1596][1596]] Deacons are ministers ordained for tasks of service of the Church; they do not receive the ministerial priesthood, but ordination confers on them important functions in the ministry of the word, divine worship, pastoral governance, and the service of charity, tasks which they must carry out under the pastoral authority of their bishop.

******** 1597
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p2s2c3a6.htm#1597][1597]] The sacrament of Holy Orders is conferred by the laying on of hands followed by a solemn prayer of consecration asking God to grant the ordinand the graces of the Holy Spirit required for his ministry. Ordination imprints an indelible sacramental character.

******** 1598
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p2s2c3a6.htm#1598][1598]] The Church confers the sacrament of Holy Orders only on baptized men ( /viri/ ), whose suitability for the exercise of the ministry has been duly recognized. Church authority alone has the responsibility and right to call someone to receive the sacrament of Holy Orders.

******** 1599
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p2s2c3a6.htm#1599][1599]] In the Latin Church the sacrament of Holy Orders for the presbyterate is normally conferred only on candidates who are ready to embrace celibacy freely and who publicly manifest their intention of staying celibate for the love of God's kingdom and the service
of men.

******** 1600
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p2s2c3a6.htm#1600][1600]] It is bishops who confer the sacrament of Holy Orders in the three degrees.

Marriage is not a purely human institution despite the many variations it may have undergone through the centuries in different cultures, social structures, and spiritual attitudes. These differences should not cause us to forget its common and permanent characteristics. Although the dignity of this institution is not transparent everywhere with the same clarity, [fn:2455] some sense of the greatness of the matrimonial union exists in all cultures.

[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p2s2c3a7.htm#1606][1606]] Every man experiences evil around him and within himself. This experience makes itself felt in the relationships between man and woman. Their union has always been threatened by discord, a spirit of domination, infidelity, jealousy, and conflicts that can escalate into hatred and separation. This disorder can manifest itself more or less acutely, and can be more or less overcome according to the circumstances of cultures, eras, and individuals, but it does seem to have a universal character.

As a break with God, the first sin had for its first consequence the rupture of the original communion between man and woman. Their relations were distorted by mutual recriminations; [fn:2463] their mutual attraction, the Creator's own gift, changed into a relationship of domination and lust; [fn:2464] and the beautiful vocation of man and woman to be fruitful, multiply, and subdue the earth was burdened by the pain of childbirth and the toil of work.

[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p2s2c3a7.htm#1630][1630]] The priest (or deacon) who assists at the celebration of a marriage receives the consent of the spouses in the name of the Church and gives the blessing of the Church. The presence of the Church's minister (and also of the witnesses) visibly expresses the fact that marriage is an ecclesial reality.

******** 1631
⁘[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p2s2c3a7.htm#1631][1631]] This is the reason why the Church normally requires that the faithful contract marriage according to the ecclesiastical form. Several reasons converge to explain this requirement: [fn:2501]

 - Sacramental marriage is a liturgical act. It is therefore appropriate that it should be celebrated in the public liturgy of the Church;

 - Marriage introduces one into an ecclesial order, and creates rights and duties in the Church between the spouses and towards their children;

 - Since marriage is a state of life in the Church, certainty about it is necessary (hence the obligation to have witnesses);

 - The public character of the consent protects the "I do" once given and helps the spouses remain faithful to it.

 The example and teaching given by parents and families remain the special form of this preparation.

 The role of pastors and of the Christian community as the "family of God" is indispensable for the transmission of the human and Christian values of marriage and family, [fn:2502] and much more so in our era when many young people experience broken homes which no longer sufficiently assure this initiation:

But the difficulties of mixed marriages must not be underestimated. They arise from the fact that the separation of Christians has not yet been overcome. The spouses risk experiencing the tragedy of Christian disunity even in the heart of their own home. Disparity of cult can further aggravate these difficulties. Differences about faith and the very notion of marriage, but also different religious mentalities, can become sources of tension in marriage, especially as regards the education of children. The temptation to religious indifference can then arise.

******* Various forms of sacramentals

In Christ, Christians are blessed by God the Father "with every spiritual blessing."

⁘[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p2s2c4a1.htm#1672][1672]] Certain blessings have a lasting importance because they consecrate persons to God, or reserve objects and places for liturgical use. Among those blessings which are intended for persons - not to be confused with sacramental ordination - are the blessing of the abbot or abbess of a monastery, the consecration of virgins and widows, the rite of religious profession and the blessing of certain ministries of the Church (readers, acolytes, catechists, etc.). The dedication or blessing of a church or an altar, the blessing of holy oils, vessels, and vestments, bells, etc., can be mentioned as examples of blessings that concern objects.

******** 1673
⁘[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p2s2c4a1.htm#1673][1673]] When the Church asks publicly and authoritatively in the name of Jesus Christ that a person or object be protected against the power of the Evil One and withdrawn from his dominion, it is called exorcism. Jesus performed exorcisms and from him the Church has received the power and office of exorcizing. [fn:2545] In a simple form, exorcism is performed at the celebration of Baptism. The solemn exorcism, called "a major exorcism," can be performed only by a priest and with the permission of the bishop. The priest must proceed with prudence, strictly observing the rules established by the Church. Exorcism is directed at the expulsion of demons or to the liberation from demonic possession through the spiritual authority which Jesus entrusted to his Church. Illness, especially psychological illness, is a very different matter; treating this is the concern of medical science. Therefore, before an exorcism is performed, it is important to ascertain that one is dealing with the presence of the Evil One, and not an illness. [fn:2546]

The religious sense of the Christian people has always found expression in various forms of piety surrounding the Church's sacramental life, such as the veneration of relics, visits to sanctuaries, pilgrimages, processions, the stations of the cross, religious dances, the rosary, medals, [fn:2547] etc.

[fn:2549] Their exercise is subject to the care and judgment of the bishops and to the general norms of the Church.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
 At its core the piety of the people is a storehouse of values that offers answers of Christian wisdom to the great questions of life. The Catholic wisdom of the people is capable of fashioning a vital synthesis. . . . It creatively combines the divine and the human, Christ and Mary, spirit and body, communion and institution, person and community, faith and homeland, intelligence and emotion. This wisdom is a Christian humanism that radically affirms the dignity of every person as a child of God, establishes a basic fraternity, teaches people to encounter nature and understand work, provides reasons for joy and humor even in the midst of a very hard life. For the people this wisdom is also a principle of discernment and an evangelical instinct through which they spontaneously sense when the Gospel is served in the Church and when it is emptied of its content and stifled by other interests.

******** 1684
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p2s2c4a2.htm#1684][1684]] The Christian funeral is a liturgical celebration of the Church. The ministry of the Church in this instance aims at expressing efficacious communion with /the deceased/ , at the participation in that communion of /the community/ gathered for the funeral, and at the proclamation of eternal life to the community.

******** 1685
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p2s2c4a2.htm#1685][1685]] The different funeral rites express the /Paschal character/ of Christian death and are in keeping with the situations and traditions of each region, even as to the color of the liturgical vestments worn. [fn:2554]

[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p2s2c4a2.htm#1686][1686]] The /Order of Christian Funerals (Ordo exsequiarum)/ of the Roman liturgy gives three types of funeral celebrations, corresponding to the three places in which they are conducted (the home, the church, and the cemetery), and according to the importance attached to them by the family, local customs, the culture, and popular piety. This order of celebration is common to all the liturgical traditions and comprises four principal elements:

******** 1687
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p2s2c4a2.htm#1687][1687]] /The greeting of the community/ . A greeting of faith begins the celebration. Relatives and friends of the deceased are welcomed with a word of "consolation" (in the New Testament sense of the Holy Spirit's power in hope). [fn:2555] The community assembling in prayer also awaits the "words of eternal life." The death of a member of the community (or the anniversary of a death, or the seventh or thirtieth day after death) is an event that should lead beyond the perspectives of "this world" and should draw the faithful into the true perspective of faith in the risen Christ.

******** 1688
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p2s2c4a2.htm#1688][1688]] The liturgy of the Word during funerals demands very careful preparation because the assembly present for the funeral may include some faithful who rarely attend the liturgy, and friends of the deceased who are not Christians.

When the celebration takes place in church the Eucharist is the heart of the Paschal reality of Christian death. [fn:2557] In the Eucharist, the Church expresses her efficacious communion with the departed: offering to the Father in the Holy Spirit the sacrifice of the death and resurrection of Christ, she asks to purify his child of his sins and their consequences, and to admit him to the Paschal fullness of the table of the Kingdom. [fn:2558] It is by the Eucharist thus celebrated that the community of the faithful, especially the family of the deceased, learn to live in communion with the one who "has fallen asleep in the Lord," by communicating in the Body of Christ of which he is a living member and, then, by praying for him and with him.

******** 1711
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p3s1c1a1.htm#1711][1711]] Endowed with a spiritual soul, with intellect and with free will, the human person is from his very conception ordered to God and destined for eternal beatitude. He pursues his perfection in "seeking and loving what is true and good" ( /GS/ 15 § 2).

******** 1712
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p3s1c1a1.htm#1712][1712]] In man, true freedom is an "outstanding manifestation of the divine image" ( /GS/ 17).

******** 1713
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p3s1c1a1.htm#1713][1713]] Man is obliged to follow the moral law, which urges him "to do what is good and avoid what is evil" (cf. /GS/ 16). This law makes itself heard in his conscience.

******** 1714
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p3s1c1a1.htm#1714][1714]] Man, having been wounded in his nature by original sin, is subject to error and inclined to evil in exercising his freedom.

******** 1715
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p3s1c1a1.htm#1715][1715]] He who believes in Christ has new life in the Holy Spirit. The moral life, increased and brought to maturity in grace, is to reach its fulfillment in the glory of heaven.

****** I. The Beatitudes
******** 1716
⁘[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p3s1c1a2.htm#1716][1716]] The Beatitudes are at the heart of Jesus' preaching. They take up the promises made to the chosen people since Abraham. The Beatitudes fulfill the promises by ordering them no longer merely to the possession of a territory, but to the Kingdom of heaven:

 Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted. Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth. Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be satisfied. Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy. Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God. Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God. Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness' sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed are you when men revile you and persecute you and utter all kinds of evil against you falsely on my account. Rejoice and be glad, for your reward is great in heaven. [fn:2597]

They express the vocation of the faithful associated with the glory of his Passion and Resurrection; they shed light on the actions and attitudes characteristic of the Christian life; they are the paradoxical promises that sustain hope in the midst of tribulations; they proclaim the blessings and rewards already secured, however dimly, for Christ's disciples; they have begun in the lives of the Virgin Mary and all the saints.

It invites us to purify our hearts of bad instincts and to seek the love of God above all else. It teaches us that true happiness is not found in riches or well-being, in human fame or power, or in any human achievement - however beneficial it may be - such as science, technology, and art, or indeed in any creature, but in God alone, the source of every good and of all love:

******** 1727
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p3s1c1a2.htm#1727][1727]] The beatitude of eternal life is a gratuitous gift of God. It is supernatural, as is the grace that leads us there.

******** 1728

[fn:2618] Moreover, the economic, social, political, and cultural conditions that are needed for a just exercise of freedom are too often disregarded or violated. Such situations of blindness and injustice injure the moral life and involve the strong as well as the weak in the temptation to sin against charity. By deviating from the moral law man violates his own freedom, becomes imprisoned within himself, disrupts neighborly fellowship, and rebels against divine truth.

**** ARTICLE 4: THE MORALITY OF HUMAN ACTS
******** 1749
⁘[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p3s1c1a4.htm#1749][1749]] Freedom makes man a moral subject. When he acts deliberately, man is, so to speak, the father of his acts. Human acts, that is, acts that are freely chosen in consequence of a judgment of conscience, can be morally evaluated. They are either good or evil.
:refs:
cr: [[*1732][1732]]. 

:end:

****** I. The Sources of Morality
******** 1750
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p3s1c1a4.htm#1750][1750]] The morality of human acts depends on:

 - the object chosen;

 - the end in view or the intention;

 - the circumstances of the action.

 The object, the intention, and the circumstances make up the "sources," or constitutive elements, of the morality of human acts.

******** 1751
⁘[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p3s1c1a4.htm#1751][1751]] The /object/ chosen is a good toward which the will deliberately directs itself. It is the matter of a human act. The object chosen morally specifies the act of the will, insofar as reason recognizes and judges it to be or not to be in conformity with the true good. Objective norms of morality express the rational order of good and evil, attested to by conscience.
:refs:
cr: [[*1794][1794]]. 

:end:

******** 1752
⁘[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p3s1c1a4.htm#1752][1752]] In contrast to the object, the /intention/ resides in the acting subject. Because it lies at the voluntary source of an action and determines it by its end, intention is an element essential to the moral evaluation of an action. The end is the first goal of the intention and indicates the purpose pursued in the action. The intention is a movement of the will toward the end: it is concerned with the goal of the activity. It aims at the good anticipated from the action undertaken. Intention is not limited to directing individual actions, but can guide several actions toward one and the same purpose; it can orient one's whole life toward its ultimate end. For example, a service done with the end of helping one's neighbor can at the same time be inspired by the love of God as the ultimate end of all our actions. One and the same action can also be inspired by several intentions, such as performing a service in order to obtain a favor or to boast about it.

******** 1753
⁘[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p3s1c1a4.htm#1753][1753]] A good intention (for example, that of helping one's neighbor) does not make behavior that is intrinsically disordered, such as lying and calumny, good or just. The end does not justify the means. Thus the condemnation of an innocent person cannot be justified as a legitimate means of saving the nation. On the other hand, an added bad intention (such as vainglory) makes an act evil that, in and of itself, can be good (such as almsgiving). [fn:2624]

⁘[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p3s1c1a4.htm#1754][1754]] The /circumstances/ , including the consequences, are secondary elements of a moral act. They contribute to increasing or diminishing the moral goodness or evil of human acts (for example, the amount of a theft). They can also diminish or increase the agent's responsibility (such as acting out of a fear of death). Circumstances of themselves cannot change the moral quality of acts themselves; they can make neither good nor right an action that is in itself evil.

****** II. Good Acts and Evil Acts
******** 1755
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p3s1c1a4.htm#1755][1755]] A /morally good/ act requires the goodness of the object, of the end, and of the circumstances together. An evil end corrupts the action, even if the object is good in itself (such as praying and fasting "in order to be seen by men").

 The /object of the choice/ can by itself vitiate an act in its entirety. There are some concrete acts - such as fornication - that it is always wrong to choose, because choosing them entails a disorder of the will, that is, a moral evil.

******** 1756
⁘[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p3s1c1a4.htm#1756][1756]] It is therefore an error to judge the morality of human acts by considering only the intention that inspires them or the circumstances (environment, social pressure, duress or emergency, etc.) which supply their context. There are acts which, in and of themselves, independently of circumstances and intentions, are always gravely illicit by reason of their object; such as blasphemy and perjury, murder and adultery. One may not do evil so that good may result from it.

******** 1765
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p3s1c1a5.htm#1765][1765]] There are many passions. The most fundamental passion is love, aroused by the attraction of the good. Love causes a desire for the absent good and the hope of obtaining it; this movement finds completion in the pleasure and joy of the good possessed. The apprehension of evil causes hatred, aversion, and fear of the impending evil; this movement ends in sadness at some present evil, or in the anger that resists it.

Passions are morally good when they contribute to a good action, evil in the opposite case. The upright will orders the movements of the senses it appropriates to the good and to beatitude; an evil will succumbs to disordered passions and exacerbates them.

[fn:2674] Hope is also a weapon that protects us in the struggle of salvation: "Let us . . . put on the breastplate of faith and charity, and for a helmet the hope of salvation." [fn:2675] It affords us joy even under trial: "Rejoice in your hope, be patient in tribulation."

[fn:2755] The common good concerns the life of all. It calls for prudence from each, and even more from those who exercise the office of authority. It consists of /three essential elements/ :

In the name of the common good, public authorities are bound to respect the fundamental and inalienable rights of the human person. Society should permit each of its members to fulfill his vocation. In particular, the common good resides in the conditions for the exercise of the natural freedoms indispensable for the development of the human vocation, such as "the right to act according to a sound norm of conscience and to safeguard . . . privacy, and rightful freedom also in matters of religion."

Development is the epitome of all social duties. Certainly, it is the proper function of authority to arbitrate, in the name of the common good, between various particular interests; but it should make accessible to each what is needed to lead a truly human life: food, clothing, health, work, education and culture, suitable information, the right to establish a family, and so on.

These rights are prior to society and must be recognized by it. They are the basis of the moral legitimacy of every authority: by flouting them, or refusing to recognize them in its positive legislation, a society undermines its own moral legitimacy.

⁘[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p3s1c3a2.htm#1996][1996]] Our justification comes from the grace of God. Grace is /favor/ , the free and undeserved help that God gives us to respond to his call to become children of God, adoptive sons, partakers of the divine nature and of eternal life. [fn:2823]

As an "adopted son" he can henceforth call God "Father," in union with the only Son. He receives the life of the Spirit who breathes charity into him and who forms the Church.

It is the /sanctifying/ or /deifying grace/ received in Baptism. It is in us the source of the work of sanctification: [fn:2825]

******** 2000
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p3s1c3a2.htm#2000][2000]] Sanctifying grace is an habitual gift, a stable and supernatural disposition that perfects the soul itself to enable it to live with God, to act by his love. /Habitual grace/ , the permanent disposition to live and act in keeping with God's call, is distinguished from actual graces which refer to God's interventions, whether at the beginning of conversion or in the course of the work of sanctification.

******** 2001
⁘[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p3s1c3a2.htm#2001][2001]] The /preparation of man/ for the reception of grace is already a work of grace. This latter is needed to arouse and sustain our collaboration in justification through faith, and in sanctification through charity. God brings to completion in us what he has begun, "since he who completes his work by cooperating with our will began by working so that we might will it:" [fn:2827]

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
 Indeed we also work, but we are only collaborating with God who works, for his mercy has gone before us. It has gone before us so that we may be healed, and follows us so that once healed, we may be given life; it goes before us so that we may be called, and follows us so that we may be glorified; it goes before us so that we may live devoutly, and follows us so that we may always live with God: for without him we can do nothing.

⁘[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p3s1c3a2.htm#2002][2002]] God's free initiative demands /man's free response/ , for God has created man in his image by conferring on him, along with freedom, the power to know him and love him. The soul only enters freely into the communion of love. God immediately touches and directly moves the heart of man. He has placed in man a longing for truth and goodness that only he can satisfy. The promises of "eternal life" respond, beyond all hope, to this desire:

But grace also includes the gifts that the Spirit grants us to associate us with his work, to enable us to collaborate in the salvation of others and in the growth of the Body of Christ, the Church. There are /sacramental graces/ , gifts proper to the different sacraments. There are furthermore /special graces/ , also called /charisms/ after the Greek term used by St. Paul and meaning "favor," "gratuitous gift," "benefit." [fn:2830] Whatever their character - sometimes it is extraordinary, such as the gift of miracles or of tongues - charisms are oriented toward sanctifying grace and are intended for the common good of the Church. They are at the service of charity which builds up the Church. [fn:2831]

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
 Having gifts that differ according to the grace given to us, let us use them: if prophecy, in proportion to our faith; if service, in our serving; he who teaches, in his teaching; he who exhorts, in his exhortation; he who contributes, in liberality; he who gives aid, with zeal; he who does acts of mercy, with cheerfulness.

******** 2005
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p3s1c3a2.htm#2005][2005]] Since it belongs to the supernatural order, grace /escapes our experience/ and cannot be known except by faith. We cannot therefore rely on our feelings or our works to conclude that we are justified and saved. [fn:2833] However, according to the Lord's words "Thus you will know them by their fruits" [fn:2834] - reflection on God's blessings in our life and in the lives of the saints offers us a guarantee that grace is at work in us and spurs us on to an ever greater faith and an attitude of trustful poverty.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
 A pleasing illustration of this attitude is found in the reply of St. Joan of Arc to a question posed as a trap by her ecclesiastical judges: "Asked if she knew that she was in God's grace, she replied: 'If I am not, may it please God to put me in it; if I am, may it please God to keep me there.'"

******** 2008
⁘[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p3s1c3a2.htm#2008][2008]] The merit of man before God in the Christian life arises from the fact that /God has freely chosen to associate man with the work of his grace/ . The fatherly action of God is first on his own initiative, and then follows man's free acting through his collaboration, so that the merit of good works is to be attributed in the first place to the grace of God, then to the faithful. Man's merit, moreover, itself is due to God, for his good actions proceed in Christ, from the predispositions and assistance given by the Holy Spirit.

This is our right by grace, the full right of love, making us "co-heirs" with Christ and worthy of obtaining "the promised inheritance of eternal life."

Moved by the Holy Spirit and by charity, /we can then merit/ for ourselves and for others the graces needed for our sanctification, for the increase of grace and charity, and for the attainment of eternal life. Even temporal goods like health and friendship can be merited in accordance with God's wisdom. These graces and goods are the object of Christian prayer.

****** IN BRIEF
******** 2017
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p3s1c3a2.htm#2017][2017]] The grace of the Holy Spirit confers upon us the righteousness of God. Uniting us by faith and Baptism to the Passion and Resurrection of Christ, the Spirit makes us sharers in his life.

******** 2018
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p3s1c3a2.htm#2018][2018]] Like conversion, justification has two aspects. Moved by grace, man turns toward God and away from sin, and so accepts forgiveness and righteousness from on high.

******** 2019
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p3s1c3a2.htm#2019][2019]] Justification includes the remission of sins, sanctification, and the renewal of the inner man.

******** 2020
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p3s1c3a2.htm#2020][2020]] Justification has been merited for us by the Passion of Christ. It is granted us through Baptism. It conforms us to the righteousness of God, who justifies us. It has for its goal the glory of God and of Christ, and the gift of eternal life. It is the most excellent work of God's mercy.

******** 2021
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p3s1c3a2.htm#2021][2021]] Grace is the help God gives us to respond to our vocation of becoming his adopted sons. It introduces us into the intimacy of the Trinitarian life.

******** 2022
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p3s1c3a2.htm#2022][2022]] The divine initiative in the work of grace precedes, prepares, and elicits the free response of man. Grace responds to the deepest yearnings of human freedom, calls freedom to cooperate with it, and perfects freedom.

******** 2023
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p3s1c3a2.htm#2023][2023]] Sanctifying grace is the gratuitous gift of his life that God makes to us; it is infused by the Holy Spirit into the soul to heal it of sin and to sanctify it.

******** 2024
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p3s1c3a2.htm#2024][2024]] Sanctifying grace makes us "pleasing to God." Charisms, special graces of the Holy Spirit, are oriented to sanctifying grace and are intended for the common good of the Church. God also acts through many actual graces, to be distinguished from habitual grace which is permanent in us.

******** 2025
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p3s1c3a2.htm#2025][2025]] We can have merit in God's sight only because of God's free plan to associate man with the work of his grace. Merit is to be ascribed in the first place to the grace of God, and secondly to man's collaboration. Man's merit is due to God.

******** 2026
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p3s1c3a2.htm#2026][2026]] The grace of the Holy Spirit can confer true merit on us, by virtue of our adoptive filiation, and in accordance with God's gratuitous justice. Charity is the principal source of merit in us before God.

******** 2027
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p3s1c3a2.htm#2027][2027]] No one can merit the initial grace which is at the origin of conversion. Moved by the Holy Spirit, we can merit for ourselves and for others all the graces needed to attain eternal life, as well as necessary temporal goods.

It is the normal flowering of the baptismal grace which has begotten us in the womb of the Church and made us members of the Body of Christ. In her motherly care, the Church grants us the mercy of God which prevails over all our sins and is especially at work in the sacrament of reconciliation. With a mother's foresight, she also lavishes on us day after day in her liturgy the nourishment of the Word and Eucharist of the Lord.

****** II. The Precepts of the Church
******** 2041
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p3s1c3a3.htm#2041][2041]] The precepts of the Church are set in the context of a moral life bound to and nourished by liturgical life. The obligatory character of these positive laws decreed by the pastoral authorities is meant to guarantee to the faithful the very necessary minimum in the spirit of prayer and moral effort, in the growth in love of God and neighbor:

******** 2042
⁘[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p3s1c3a3.htm#2042][2042]] The first precept ("You shall attend Mass on Sundays and holy days of obligation and rest from servile labor") requires the faithful to sanctify the day commemorating the Resurrection of the Lord as well as the principal liturgical feasts honoring the mysteries of the Lord, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and the saints; in the first place, by participating in the Eucharistic celebration, in which the Christian community is gathered, and by resting from those works and activities which could impede such a sanctification of these days. [fn:2859]

 The second precept ("You shall confess your sins at least once a year") ensures preparation for the Eucharist by the reception of the sacrament of reconciliation, which continues Baptism's work of conversion and forgiveness. [fn:2860]

 The third precept ("You shall receive the sacrament of the Eucharist at least during the Easter season") guarantees as a minimum the reception of the Lord's Body and Blood in connection with the Paschal feasts, the origin and center of the Christian liturgy. [fn:2861]

****** IN BRIEF
******** 2047
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p3s1c3a3.htm#2047][2047]] The moral life is a spiritual worship. Christian activity finds its nourishment in the liturgy and the celebration of the sacraments.

[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p3s1c3a3.htm#2049][2049]] The Magisterium of the Pastors of the Church in moral matters is ordinarily exercised in catechesis and preaching, on the basis of the Decalogue which states the principles of moral life valid for every man.

******** 2050
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p3s1c3a3.htm#2050][2050]] The Roman Pontiff and the bishops, as authentic teachers, preach to the People of God the faith which is to be believed and applied in moral life. It is also incumbent on them to pronounce on moral questions that fall within the natural law and reason.

******** 2051
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p3s1c3a3.htm#2051][2051]] The infallibility of the Magisterium of the Pastors extends to all the elements of doctrine, including moral doctrine, without which the saving truths of the faith cannot be preserved, expounded, or observed.

******* "Teacher, what must I do . . .?"
******** 2052
⁘[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p3s2.htm#2052][2052]] "Teacher, what good deed must I do, to have eternal life?" To the young man who asked this question, Jesus answers first by invoking the necessity to recognize God as the "One there is who is good," as the supreme Good and the source of all good. Then Jesus tells him: "If you would enter life, keep the commandments." And he cites for his questioner the precepts that concern love of neighbor: "You shall not kill, You shall not commit adultery, You shall not steal, You shall not bear false witness, Honor your father and mother." Finally Jesus sums up these commandments positively: "You shall love your neighbor as yourself." [fn:2869]

[fn:2870] This reply does not do away with the first: following Jesus Christ involves keeping the Commandments. The Law has not been abolished, [fn:2871] but rather man is invited to rediscover it in the person of his Master who is its perfect fulfillment. In the three synoptic Gospels, Jesus' call to the rich young man to follow him, in the obedience of a disciple and in the observance of the Commandments, is joined to the call to poverty and chastity.

And a second is like it: You shall love your neighbor as yourself. On these two commandments hang all the Law and the prophets." [fn:2877] The Decalogue must be interpreted in light of this twofold yet single commandment of love, the fullness of the Law:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
 The commandments: "You shall not commit adultery, You shall not kill, You shall not steal, You shall not covet," and any other commandment, are summed up in this sentence: "You shall love your neighbor as yourself."

⁘[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p3s2.htm#2056][2056]] The word "Decalogue" means literally "ten words." [fn:2879] God revealed these "ten words" to his people on the holy mountain. They were written "with the finger of God," [fn:2880] unlike the other commandments written by Moses. [fn:2881] They are pre-eminently the words of God. They are handed on to us in the books of /Exodus/ [fn:2882] and /Deuteronomy/ .

******** 2057
⁘[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p3s2.htm#2057][2057]] The Decalogue must first be understood in the context of the Exodus, God's great liberating event at the center of the Old Covenant. Whether formulated as negative commandments, prohibitions, or as positive precepts such as: "Honor your father and mother," the "ten words" point out the conditions of a life freed from the slavery of sin. The Decalogue is a path of life:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE

And he wrote them upon two tables of stone, and gave them to me." [fn:2887] For this reason these two tables are called "the Testimony."

In all God's commandments, the singular personal pronoun designates the recipient. God makes his will known to each person in particular, at the same time as he makes it known to the whole people:

[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p3s2.htm#2065][2065]] Ever since St. Augustine, the Ten Commandments have occupied a predominant place in the catechesis of baptismal candidates and the faithful. In the fifteenth century, the custom arose of expressing the commandments of the Decalogue in rhymed formulae, easy to memorize and in positive form. They are still in use today. The catechisms of the Church have often expounded Christian morality by following the order of the Ten Commandments.

The present catechism follows the division of the Commandments established by St. Augustine, which has become traditional in the Catholic Church. It is also that of the Lutheran confessions.

The first word contains the first commandment of the Law: "You shall fear the LORD your God; you shall serve him. . . .  You shall not go after other gods."

When we say 'God' we confess a constant, unchangeable being, always the same, faithful and just, without any evil. It follows that we must necessarily accept his words and have complete faith in him and acknowledge his authority. He is almighty, merciful, and infinitely beneficent. Who could not place all hope in him? Who could not love him when contemplating the treasures of goodness and love he has poured out on us?

 /Voluntary doubt/ about the faith disregards or refuses to hold as true what God has revealed and the Church proposes for belief. /Involuntary doubt/ refers to hesitation in believing, difficulty in overcoming objections connected with the faith, or also anxiety aroused by its obscurity.

⁘[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p3s2c1a1.htm#2090][2090]] When God reveals Himself and calls him, man cannot fully respond to the divine love by his own powers. He must hope that God will give him the capacity to love Him in return and to act in conformity with the commandments of charity. Hope is the confident expectation of divine blessing and the beatific vision of God; it is also the fear of offending God's love and of incurring punishment.

******** 2091
⁘[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p3s2c1a1.htm#2091][2091]] The first commandment is also concerned with sins against hope, namely, despair and presumption:

 By /despair/ , man ceases to hope for his personal salvation from God, for help in attaining it or for the forgiveness of his sins. Despair is contrary to God's goodness, to his justice - for the Lord is faithful to his promises - and to his mercy.

 - /indifference/ neglects or refuses to reflect on divine charity; it fails to consider its prevenient goodness and denies its power.

 - /ingratitude/ fails or refuses to acknowledge divine charity and to return him love for love.

 - /lukewarmness/ is hesitation or negligence in responding to divine love; it can imply refusal to give oneself over to the prompting of charity.

 - /acedia/ or spiritual sloth goes so far as to refuse the joy that comes from God and to be repelled by divine goodness.

 - /hatred of God/ comes from pride. It is contrary to love of God, whose goodness it denies, and whom it presumes to curse as the one who forbids sins and inflicts punishments.

To adore God is to acknowledge him as God, as the Creator and Savior, the Lord and Master of everything that exists, as infinite and merciful Love. "You shall worship the Lord your God, and him only shall you serve," says Jesus, citing /Deuteronomy/ . [fn:2915]

To adore God is to praise and exalt him and to humble oneself, as Mary did in the Magnificat, confessing with gratitude that he has done great things and holy is his name. [fn:2916] The worship of the one God sets man free from turning in on himself, from the slavery of sin and the idolatry of the world.

******** 2098
⁘[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p3s2c1a1.htm#2098][2098]] The acts of faith, hope, and charity enjoined by the first commandment are accomplished in prayer. Lifting up the mind toward God is an expression of our adoration of God: prayer of praise and thanksgiving, intercession and petition. Prayer is an indispensable condition for being able to obey God's commandments. "[We] ought always to pray and not lose heart." [fn:2917]

" [fn:2919] The prophets of the Old Covenant often denounced sacrifices that were not from the heart or not coupled with love of neighbor. [fn:2920] Jesus recalls the words of the prophet Hosea: "I desire mercy, and not sacrifice." [fn:2921] The only perfect sacrifice is the one that Christ offered on the cross as a total offering to the Father's love and for our salvation. [fn:2922] By uniting ourselves with his sacrifice we can make our lives a sacrifice to God.

Baptism and Confirmation, Matrimony and Holy Orders always entail promises. Out of personal devotion, the Christian may also promise to God this action, that prayer, this alms-giving, that pilgrimage, and so forth. Fidelity to promises made to God is a sign of the respect owed to the divine majesty and of love for a faithful God.

[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p3s2c1a1.htm#2110][2110]] The first commandment forbids honoring gods other than the one Lord who has revealed himself to his people. It proscribes superstition and irreligion. Superstition in some sense represents a perverse excess of religion; irreligion is the vice contrary by defect to the virtue of religion.

It can even affect the worship we offer the true God, e.g., when one attributes an importance in some way magical to certain practices otherwise lawful or necessary.

In recent times it has become evident that these cruel practices were neither necessary for public order, nor in conformity with the legitimate rights of the human person.

 The expression "free union" is fallacious: what can "union" mean when the partners make no commitment to one another, each exhibiting a lack of trust in the other, in himself, or in the future?

 The expression covers a number of different situations: concubinage, rejection of marriage as such, or inability to make long-term commitments.

Truth in words, the rational expression of the knowledge of created and uncreated reality, is necessary to man, who is endowed with intellect. But truth can also find other complementary forms of human expression, above all when it is a matter of evoking what is beyond words: the depths of the human heart, the exaltations of the soul, the mystery of God. Even before revealing himself to man in words of truth, God reveals himself to him through the universal language of creation, the work of his Word, of his wisdom: the order and harmony of the cosmos-which both the child and the scientist discover-"from the greatness and beauty of created things comes a corresponding perception of their Creator," "for the author of beauty created them."

Arising from talent given by the Creator and from man's own effort, art is a form of practical wisdom, uniting knowledge and skill, [fn:3322] to give form to the truth of reality in a language accessible to sight or hearing. To the extent that it is inspired by truth and love of beings, art bears a certain likeness to God's activity in what he has created.

The heart is our hidden center, beyond the grasp of our reason and of others; only the Spirit of God can fathom the human heart and know it fully. The heart is the place of decision, deeper than our psychic drives. It is the place of truth, where we choose life or death. It is the place of encounter, because as image of God we live in relation: it is the place of covenant.

******* Prayer as communion

The grace of the Kingdom is "the union of the entire holy and royal Trinity . . . with the whole human spirit." [fn:3385] Thus, the life of prayer is the habit of being in the presence of the thrice-holy God and in communion with him. This communion of life is always possible because, through Baptism, we have already been united with Christ. [fn:3386] Prayer is /Christian/ insofar as it is communion with Christ and extends throughout the Church, which is his Body. Its dimensions are those of Christ's love. [fn:3387]

Man may forget his Creator or hide far from his face; he may run after idols or accuse the deity of having abandoned him; yet the living and true God tirelessly calls each person to that mysterious encounter known as prayer. In prayer, the faithful God's initiative of love always comes first; our own first step is always a response. As God gradually reveals himself and reveals man to himself, prayer appears as a reciprocal call, a covenant drama. Through words and actions, this drama engages the heart.

[fn:3407] This event will remain one of the primordial images of prayer in the spiritual tradition of Jews and Christians alike. When "the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob" calls Moses to be his servant, it is because he is the living God who wants men to live. God reveals himself in order to save them, though he does not do this alone or despite them: he calls Moses to be his messenger, an associate in his compassion, his work of salvation. There is something of a divine plea in this mission, and only after long debate does Moses attune his own will to that of the Savior God. But in the dialogue in which God confides in him, Moses also learns how to pray: he balks, makes excuses, above all questions: and it is in response to his question that the Lord confides his ineffable name, which will be revealed through his mighty deeds.

Jesus prays /before/ the decisive moments of his mission: before his Father's witness to him during his baptism and Transfiguration, and before his own fulfillment of the Father's plan of love by his Passion. [fn:3430] He also prays before the decisive moments involving the mission of his apostles: at his election and call of the Twelve, before Peter's confession of him as "the Christ of God," and again that the faith of the chief of the Apostles may not fail when tempted. [fn:3431] Jesus' prayer before the events of salvation that the Father has asked him to fulfill is a humble and trusting commitment of his human will to the loving will of the Father.

In the first, Jesus confesses the Father, acknowledges, and blesses him because he has hidden the mysteries of the Kingdom from those who think themselves learned and has revealed them to infants, the poor of the Beatitudes. [fn:3435] His exclamation, "Yes, Father!" expresses the depth of his heart, his adherence to the Father's "good pleasure," echoing his mother's /Fiat/ at the time of his conception and prefiguring what he will say to the Father in his agony. The whole prayer of Jesus is contained in this loving adherence of his human heart to the mystery of the will of the Father. [fn:3436]

Jesus immediately adds: "I know that you always hear me," which implies that Jesus, on his part, /constantly made such petitions./ Jesus' prayer, characterized by thanksgiving, reveals to us how to ask: /before/ the gift is given, Jesus commits himself to the One who in giving gives himself. The Giver is more precious than the gift; he is the "treasure"; in him abides his Son's heart; the gift is given "as well." [fn:3438]

His prayer to his Father is the theological path (the path of faith, hope, and charity) of our prayer to God. But the Gospel also gives us Jesus' explicit teaching on prayer. Like a wise teacher he takes hold of us where we are and leads us progressively toward the Father. Addressing the crowds following him, Jesus builds on what they already know of prayer from the Old Covenant and opens to them the newness of the coming Kingdom. Then he reveals this newness to them in parables. Finally, he will speak openly of the Father and the Holy Spirit to his disciples who will be the teachers of prayer in his Church.

[fn:3491] It is a prerequisite for righteous and pure prayer. A trusting humility brings us back into the light of communion between the Father and his Son Jesus Christ and with one another, so that "we receive from him whatever we ask."

It shares in the blessed happiness of the pure of heart who love God in faith before seeing him in glory. By praise, the Spirit is joined to our spirits to bear witness that we are children of God, [fn:3507] testifying to the only Son in whom we are adopted and by whom we glorify the Father.

[fn:3514] The prophets and the saints, all those who were slain on earth for their witness to Jesus, the vast throng of those who, having come through the great tribulation, have gone before us into the Kingdom, all sing the praise and glory of him who sits on the throne, and of the Lamb. [fn:3515] In communion with them, the Church on earth also sings these songs with faith in the midst of trial. By means of petition and intercession, faith hopes against all hope and gives thanks to the "Father of lights," from whom "every perfect gift" comes down. [fn:3516] Thus faith is pure praise.

The spiritual writers sometimes compare the heart to an altar. Prayer internalizes and assimilates the liturgy during and after its celebration.

 /Full of grace, the Lord is with thee/ : These two phrases of the angel's greeting shed light on one another. Mary is full of grace because the Lord is with her.

 /Blessed art thou among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus/ . After the angel's greeting, we make Elizabeth's greeting our own. "Filled with the Holy Spirit," Elizabeth is the first in the long succession of generations who have called Mary "blessed." [fn:3550] "Blessed is she who believed. . . .

The mind seeks to understand the why and how of the Christian life, in order to adhere and respond to what the Lord is asking. The required attentiveness is difficult to sustain. We are usually helped by books, and Christians do not want for them: the Sacred Scriptures, particularly the Gospels, holy icons, liturgical texts of the day or season, writings of the spiritual fathers, works of spirituality, the great book of creation, and that of history the page on which the "today" of God is written.

We pass from thoughts to reality. To the extent that we are humble and faithful, we discover in meditation the movements that stir the heart and we are able to discern them. It is a question of acting truthfully in order to come into the light: "Lord, what do you want me to do?"

St. Teresa answers: "Contemplative prayer [ /oracion mental/ ] in my opinion is nothing else than a close sharing between friends; it means taking time frequently to be alone with him who we know loves us." [fn:3572] Contemplative prayer seeks him "whom my soul loves." [fn:3573] It is Jesus, and in him, the Father. We seek him, because to desire him is always the beginning of love, and we seek him in that pure faith which causes us to be born of him and to live in him. In this inner prayer we can still meditate, but our attention is fixed on the Lord himself.

We let our masks fall and turn our hearts back to the Lord who loves us, so as to hand ourselves over to him as an offering to be purified and transformed.

"I look at him and he looks at me": this is what a certain peasant of Ars in the time of his holy curé used to say while praying before the tabernacle. This focus on Jesus is a renunciation of self. His gaze purifies our heart; the light of the countenance of Jesus illumines the eyes of our heart and teaches us to see everything in the light of his truth and his compassion for all men. Contemplation also turns its gaze on the mysteries of the life of Christ. Thus it learns the "interior knowledge of our Lord," the more to love him and follow him. [fn:3577]

[fn:3579] Words in this kind of prayer are not speeches; they are like kindling that feeds the fire of love. In this silence, unbearable to the "outer" man, the Father speaks to us his incarnate Word, who suffered, died, and rose; in this silence the Spirit of adoption enables us to share in the prayer of Jesus.

The Paschal night of the Resurrection passes through the night of the agony and the tomb - the three intense moments of the Hour of Jesus which his Spirit (and not "the flesh [which] is weak") brings to life in prayer. We must be willing to "keep watch with [him] one hour." [fn:3580]

******** 2721
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p4s1c3a1.htm#2721][2721]] The Christian tradition comprises three major expressions of the life of prayer: vocal prayer, meditation, and contemplative prayer. They have in common the recollection of the heart.

******** 2722
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p4s1c3a1.htm#2722][2722]] Vocal prayer, founded on the union of body and soul in human nature, associates the body with the interior prayer of the heart, following Christ's example of praying to his Father and teaching the Our Father to his disciples.

******** 2723
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p4s1c3a1.htm#2723][2723]] Meditation is a prayerful quest engaging thought, imagination, emotion, and desire. Its goal is to make our own in faith the subject considered, by confronting it with the reality of our own life.

******** 2724
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p4s1c3a1.htm#2724][2724]] Contemplative prayer is the simple expression of the mystery of prayer. It is a gaze of faith fixed on Jesus, an attentiveness to the Word of God, a silent love. It achieves real union with the prayer of Christ to the extent that it makes us share in his mystery.

**** ARTICLE 2: THE BATTLE OF PRAYER
******** 2725
⁘[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p4s1c3a2.htm#2725][2725]] Prayer is both a gift of grace and a determined response on our part. It always presupposes effort. The great figures of prayer of the Old Covenant before Christ, as well as the Mother of God, the saints, and he himself, all teach us this: prayer is a battle. Against whom? Against ourselves and against the wiles of the tempter who does all he can to turn man away from prayer, away from union with God. We pray as we live, because we live as we pray. If we do not want to act habitually according to the Spirit of Christ, neither can we pray habitually in his name. The "spiritual battle" of the Christian's new life is inseparable from the battle of prayer.

****** I. Objections to Prayer
******** 2726
⁘[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p4s1c3a2.htm#2726][2726]] In the battle of prayer, we must face in ourselves and around us /erroneous notions of prayer/ . Some people view prayer as a simple psychological activity, others as an effort of concentration to reach a mental void. Still others reduce prayer to ritual words and postures. Many Christians unconsciously regard prayer as an occupation that is incompatible with all the other things they have to do: they "don't have the time." Those who seek God by prayer are quickly discouraged because they do not know that prayer comes also from the Holy Spirit and not from themselves alone.

:end:

******** 2727
⁘[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p4s1c3a2.htm#2727][2727]] We must also face the fact that certain attitudes deriving from the /mentality/ of "this present world" can penetrate our lives if we are not vigilant. For example, some would have it that only that is true which can be verified by reason and science; yet prayer is a mystery that overflows both our conscious and unconscious lives. Others overly prize production and profit; thus prayer, being unproductive, is useless. Still others exalt sensuality and comfort as the criteria of the true, the good, and the beautiful; whereas prayer, the "love of beauty" ( /philokalia/ ), is caught up in the glory of the living and true God. Finally, some see prayer as a flight from the world in reaction against activism; but in fact, Christian prayer is neither an escape from reality nor a divorce from life.

******** 2728
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p4s1c3a2.htm#2728][2728]] Finally, our battle has to confront what we experience as /failure in prayer/ : discouragement during periods of dryness; sadness that, because we have "great possessions," [fn:3581] we have not given all to the Lord; disappointment over not being heard according to our own will; wounded pride, stiffened by the indignity that is ours as sinners; our resistance to the idea that prayer is a free and unmerited gift; and so forth. The conclusion is always the same: what good does it do to pray? To overcome these obstacles, we must battle to gain humility, trust, and perseverance.

****** II. Humble Vigilance of Heart
******* Facing difficulties in prayer
******** 2729
⁘[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p4s1c3a2.htm#2729][2729]] The habitual difficulty in prayer is /distraction/ . It can affect words and their meaning in vocal prayer; it can concern, more profoundly, him to whom we are praying, in vocal prayer (liturgical or personal), meditation, and contemplative prayer. To set about hunting down distractions would be to fall into their trap, when all that is necessary is to turn back to our heart: for a distraction reveals to us what we are attached to, and this humble awareness before the Lord should awaken our preferential love for him and lead us resolutely to offer him our heart to be purified. Therein lies the battle, the choice of which master to serve. [fn:3582]

******** 2730
⁘[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p4s1c3a2.htm#2730][2730]] In positive terms, the battle against the possessive and dominating self requires vigilance, sobriety of heart. When Jesus insists on /vigilance/ , he always relates it to himself, to his coming on the last day and every day: /today/ . The bridegroom comes in the middle of the night; the light that must not be extinguished is that of faith: "'Come,' my heart says, 'seek his face!'" [fn:3583]

******** 2731
⁘[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p4s1c3a2.htm#2731][2731]] Another difficulty, especially for those who sincerely want to pray, is /dryness/ . Dryness belongs to contemplative prayer when the heart is separated from God, with no taste for thoughts, memories, and feelings, even spiritual ones. This is the moment of sheer faith clinging faithfully to Jesus in his agony and in his tomb. "Unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains alone; but if dies, it bears much fruit." [fn:3584] If dryness is due to the lack of roots, because the word has fallen on rocky soil, the battle requires conversion. [fn:3585]

******* Facing temptations in prayer
******** 2732
⁘[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p4s1c3a2.htm#2732][2732]] The most common yet most hidden temptation is our /lack of faith/ . It expresses itself less by declared incredulity than by our actual preferences. When we begin to pray, a thousand labors or cares thought to be urgent vie for priority; once again, it is the moment of truth for the heart: what is its real love? Sometimes we turn to the Lord as a last resort, but do we really believe he is? Sometimes we enlist the Lord as an ally, but our heart remains presumptuous. In each case, our lack of faith reveals that we do not yet share in the disposition of a humble heart: "Apart from me, you can do /nothing/ ." [fn:3586]

******** 2733
⁘[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p4s1c3a2.htm#2733][2733]] Another temptation, to which presumption opens the gate, is /acedia/ . The spiritual writers understand by this a form of depression due to lax ascetical practice, decreasing vigilance, carelessness of heart. "The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak." [fn:3587] The greater the height, the harder the fall. Painful as discouragement is, it is the reverse of presumption. The humble are not surprised by their distress; it leads them to trust more, to hold fast in constancy.

[fn:3588] The principal difficulty concerns the /prayer of petition/ , for oneself or for others in intercession. Some even stop praying because they think their petition is not heard.

"Or do you suppose that it is in vain that the scripture says, 'He yearns jealously over the spirit which he has made to dwell in us?'"

****** IN BRIEF
******** 2752
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p4s1c3a3.htm#2752][2752]] Prayer presupposes an effort, a fight against ourselves and the wiles of the Tempter. The battle of prayer is inseparable from the necessary "spiritual battle" to act habitually according to the Spirit of Christ: we pray as we live, because we live as we pray.

******** 2753
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p4s1c3a3.htm#2753][2753]] In the battle of prayer we must confront erroneous conceptions of prayer, various currents of thought, and our own experience of failure. We must respond with humility, trust, and perseverance to these temptations which cast doubt on the usefulness or even the possibility of prayer.

******** 2754
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p4s1c3a3.htm#2754][2754]] The principal difficulties in the practice of prayer are distraction and dryness. The remedy lies in faith, conversion, and vigilance of heart.

******** 2755
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p4s1c3a3.htm#2755][2755]] Two frequent temptations threaten prayer: lack of faith and acedia - a form of depression stemming from lax ascetical practice that leads to discouragement.

******** 2756
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p4s1c3a3.htm#2756][2756]] Filial trust is put to the test when we feel that our prayer is not always heard. The Gospel invites us to ask ourselves about the conformity of our prayer to the desire of the Spirit.

******** 2757
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p4s1c3a3.htm#2757][2757]] "Pray constantly" ( /1 Thess/ 5:17). It is always possible to pray. It is even a vital necessity. Prayer and Christian life are inseparable.

******** 2758
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p4s1c3a3.htm#2758][2758]] The prayer of the hour of Jesus, rightly called the "priestly prayer" (cf. /Jn/ 17), sums up the whole economy of creation and salvation. It fulfills the great petitions of the Our Father.

** SECTION TWO: THE LORD'S PRAYER: "OUR FATHER!"
******** 2759
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p4s2.htm#2759][2759]] Jesus "was praying at a certain place, and when he ceased, one of his disciples said to him, 'Lord, teach us to pray, as John taught his disciples.'" [fn:3618] In response to this request the Lord entrusts to his disciples and to his Church the fundamental Christian prayer. St. Luke presents a brief text of five petitions, [fn:3619] while St. Matthew gives a more developed version of seven petitions. [fn:3620] The liturgical tradition of the Church has retained St. Matthew's text:

In the /Didache/ , we find, "For yours are the power and the glory for ever." [fn:3621] The /Apostolic Constitutions/ add to the beginning: "the kingdom," and this is the formula retained to our day in ecumenical prayer. [fn:3622] The Byzantine tradition adds after "the glory" the words "Father, Son, and Holy Spirit." The /Roman Missal/ develops the last petition in the explicit perspective of "awaiting our blessed hope" and of the Second Coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. [fn:3623] Then comes the assembly's acclamation or the repetition of the doxology from the /Apostolic Constitutions/ .

******** 2765
⁘[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p4s2a1.htm#2765][2765]] The traditional expression "the Lord's Prayer" - /oratio Dominica/ - means that the prayer to our Father is taught and given to us by the Lord Jesus. The prayer that comes to us from Jesus is truly unique: it is "of the Lord." On the one hand, in the words of this prayer the only Son gives us the words the Father gave him: [fn:3630] he is the master of our prayer. On the other, as Word incarnate, he knows in his human heart the needs of his human brothers and sisters and reveals them to us: he is the model of our prayer.

[fn:3631] As in every vocal prayer, it is through the Word of God that the Holy Spirit teaches the children of God to pray to their Father. Jesus not only gives us the words of our filial prayer; at the same time he gives us the Spirit by whom these words become in us "spirit and life." [fn:3632] Even more, the proof and possibility of our filial prayer is that the Father "sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying, ' /Abba!/ Father!'" [fn:3633] Since our prayer sets forth our desires before God, it is again the Father, "he who searches the hearts of men," who "knows what is the mind of the Spirit, because the Spirit intercedes for the saints according to the will of God." [fn:3634] The prayer to Our Father is inserted into the mysterious mission of the Son and of the Spirit.

⁘[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p4s2a1.htm#2769][2769]] In /Baptism/ and /Confirmation/ , the handing on ( /traditio/ ) of the Lord's Prayer signifies new birth into the divine life. Since Christian prayer is our speaking to God with the very word of God, those who are "born anew". . . through the living and abiding word of God" [fn:3637] learn to invoke their Father by the one Word he always hears. They can henceforth do so, for the seal of the Holy Spirit's anointing is indelibly placed on their hearts, ears, lips, indeed their whole filial being. This is why most of the patristic commentaries on the Our Father are addressed to catechumens and neophytes. When the Church prays the Lord's Prayer, it is always the people made up of the "new-born" who pray and obtain mercy. [fn:3638]

United with the only Son, who has become "the firstborn among many brethren," she is in communion with one and the same Father in one and the same Holy Spirit.

[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p4s2a2.htm#2797][2797]] Simple and faithful trust, humble and joyous assurance are the proper dispositions for one who prays the Our Father.

******** 2798
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p4s2a2.htm#2798][2798]] We can invoke God as "Father" because the Son of God made man has revealed him to us. In this Son, through Baptism, we are incorporated and adopted as sons of God.

[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p4s2a2.htm#2800][2800]] Praying to our Father should develop in us the will to become like him and foster in us a humble and trusting heart.

******** 2801
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p4s2a2.htm#2801][2801]] When we say "Our" Father, we are invoking the new covenant in Jesus Christ, communion with the Holy Trinity, and the divine love which spreads through the Church to encompass the world.

It is characteristic of love to think first of the one whom we love. In none of the three petitions do we mention ourselves; the burning desire, even anguish, of the beloved Son for his Father's glory seizes us: [fn:3681] "hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come, thy will be done. . . .

Being creatures and still sinners, we have to petition for us, for that "us" bound by the world and history, which we offer to the boundless love of God.

And so, in adoration, this invocation is sometimes understood as praise and thanksgiving. [fn:3683] But this petition is here taught to us by Jesus as an optative: a petition, a desire, and an expectation in which God and man are involved. Beginning with this first petition to our Father, we are immersed in the innermost mystery of his Godhead and the drama of the salvation of our humanity. Asking the Father that his name be made holy draws us into his plan of loving kindness for the fullness of time, "according to his purpose which he set forth in Christ," that we might "be holy and blameless before him in love."

[fn:3689] From the covenant of Sinai onwards, this people is "his own" and it is to be a "holy (or "consecrated": the same word is used for both in Hebrew) nation," [fn:3690] because the name of God dwells in it.

⁘[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p4s2a3.htm#2853][2853]] Victory over the "prince of this world" [fn:3786] was won once for all at the Hour when Jesus freely gave himself up to death to give us his life. This is the judgment of this world, and the prince of this world is "cast out." [fn:3787] "He pursued the woman" [fn:3788] but had no hold on her: the new Eve, "full of grace" of the Holy Spirit, is preserved from sin and the corruption of death (the Immaculate Conception and the Assumption of the Most Holy Mother of God, Mary, ever virgin). "Then the dragon was angry with the woman, and went off to make war on the rest of her offspring." [fn:3789] Therefore the Spirit and the Church pray: "Come, Lord Jesus," [fn:3790] since his coming will deliver us from the Evil One.

In this final petition, the Church brings before the Father all the distress of the world. Along with deliverance from the evils that overwhelm humanity, she implores the precious gift of peace and the grace of perseverance in expectation of Christ's return By praying in this way, she anticipates in humility of faith the gathering together of everyone and everything in him who has "the keys of Death and Hades," who "is and who was and who is to come, the Almighty." [fn:3791]

**** ARTICLE 4: THE FINAL DOXOLOGY
******** 2855
⁘[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p4s2a4.htm#2855][2855]] The final doxology, "For the kingdom, the power and the glory are yours, now and forever," takes up again, by inclusion, the first three petitions to our Father: the glorification of his name, the coming of his reign, and the power of his saving will. But these prayers are now proclaimed as adoration and thanksgiving, as in the liturgy of heaven. [fn:3793] The ruler of this world has mendaciously attributed to himself the three titles of kingship, power, and glory. [fn:3794] Christ, the Lord, restores them to his Father and our Father, until he hands over the kingdom to him when the mystery of salvation will be brought to its completion and God will be all in all.

****** IN BRIEF
******** 2857
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p4s2a4.htm#2857][2857]] In the Our Father, the object of the first three petitions is the glory of the Father: the sanctification of his name, the coming of the kingdom, and the fulfillment of his will. The four others present our wants to him: they ask that our lives be nourished, healed of sin, and made victorious in the struggle of good over evil.

******** 2858
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p4s2a4.htm#2858][2858]] By asking "hallowed be thy name" we enter into God's plan, the sanctification of his name - revealed first to Moses and then in Jesus - by us and in us, in every nation and in each man.

******** 2859
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p4s2a4.htm#2859][2859]] By the second petition, the Church looks first to Christ's return and the final coming of the Reign of God. It also prays for the growth of the Kingdom of God in the "today" of our own lives.

******** 2860
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p4s2a4.htm#2860][2860]] In the third petition, we ask our Father to unite our will to that of his Son, so as to fulfill his plan of salvation in the life of the world.

******** 2861
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p4s2a4.htm#2861][2861]] In the fourth petition, by saying "give us," we express in communion with our brethren our filial trust in our heavenly Father. "Our daily bread" refers to the earthly nourishment necessary to everyone for subsistence, and also to the Bread of Life: the Word of God and the Body of Christ. It is received in God's "today," as the indispensable, (super-) essential nourishment of the feast of the coming Kingdom anticipated in the Eucharist.

******** 2862
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p4s2a4.htm#2862][2862]] The fifth petition begs God's mercy for our offences, mercy which can penetrate our hearts only if we have learned to forgive our enemies, with the example and help of Christ.

******** 2863
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p4s2a4.htm#2863][2863]] When we say "lead us not into temptation" we are asking God not to allow us to take the path that leads to sin. This petition implores the Spirit of discernment and strength; it requests the grace of vigilance and final perseverance.

******** 2864
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p4s2a4.htm#2864][2864]] In the last petition, "but deliver us from evil," Christians pray to God with the Church to show forth the victory, already won by Christ, over the "ruler of this world," Satan, the angel personally opposed to God and to his plan of salvation.

******** 2865
[[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p4s2a4.htm#2865][2865]] By the final "Amen," we express our "fiat" concerning the seven petitions: "So be it."
