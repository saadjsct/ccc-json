Prefatory Note to Index


The following index is an English translation of the Index Analyticus that appeared in the Latin typical 
edition of the Catechism of the Catholic Church, promulgated on August 15, 1997. For the most part, this 
index is a literal rendering of the Latin, with attention given to maintaining consistency with the language 
of the English edition of the Catechism of the Catholic Church. The Index Analyticus was designed to be both 
a general subject index as well as a conceptual index of the contents of the Catechism, and this English 
translation is faithful to that design. This English translation does not participate in the approval of the 
Latin typical edition given in the apostolic letter Laetamur Magnopere of Pope John Paul II, by which the 
Latin text was approved and promulgated.
